</head>

<p>WHEREAS, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and
other Military Chieftains have, by force of arms, over<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thrown
the Federal Institutions of Mexico, and dissolved
the Social Compact which existed between Texas and other
Members of the Mexican Confederacy—Now, the good Peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple
of Texas, availing themselves of their natural rights,</p>

<head>SOLEMNLY DECLARE</head>

<p>1st. That they have taken up arms in defence of their
Rights and Liberties, which were threatened by the encroach<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments
of military despots, and. in defence of the Republican
Principles of the Federal Constitution of Mexico of eighteen
hundred and twenty-four.</p>

<p>2d. That Texas is no longer, morally or civilly, bound by
the Compact of Union; yet, stimulated by the generosity
and sympathy common to a free people, they offer their
support and assistance to such of the Members of the Mexican
Confederacy as will take up arms against military despot<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ism.</p>

<p>3d. That they do not acknowledge, that the present au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorities
of the nominal Mexican Republic have the right to
govern within the limits of Texas.</p>

<p>4th. That they will not cease to carry on war against the
said authorities, whilst their troops are within the limits of
Texas.</p>

<p>5th. That they hold it to be their right, during the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />organization
of the Federal System, and the reign
of despotism, to withdraw from the Union, to establish an

independent Government, or to adopt such measures as they
may deem best calculated to protect their rights and liberties;
but that they will continue faithful to the Mexican Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
so long as that nation is governed by the Constitution
and Laws that were formed for the government of the Politi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cal
Association.</p>

<p>6th. That Texas is responsible for the expenses of her Ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mies
now in the field.</p>

<p>7th. That the public faith of Texas is pledged for the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of any debts contracted by her Agents.</p>

<p>8th. That she will reward by donations in Land, all who
volunteer their services in her present struggle, and receive
them as Citizens.</p>

<p>These Declarations we solemnly avow to the world, and
call GOD to witness their truth and sincerity; and invoke
defeat and disgrace upon our heads, should we prove guilty
of duplicity.</p>
