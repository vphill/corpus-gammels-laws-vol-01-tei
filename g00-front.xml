COMPILER’S NOTICE.
This law publication consists of ten large octavo volumes, in
sheep, of 1500 pages each, of which this volume is a specimen. It
will be issued at the rate of one volume every sixty days till com-
pleted; for which the subscribers will pay as they receive them.
Perhaps this is the largest and costliest work on private ac-
count ever printed in Texas. The collection of the documents
cost me much labor and research, in which I was materially aided
by Judge C. W. Raines. In perfecting and bringing this work
before the public I have spared neither trouble nor expense. It is
an exact reprint of the originals or copies, verbatim et literatim; I
therefore disclaim all responsibility for the spelling and capilaliza-
tion of words and the punctuation and arrangement of sentences.
Conscious of no motive but of being useful to the community, I now
submit it to a discriminating public. My hope of remuneration
for outlay is in the Texas bar, for whose particular benefit the
work was undertaken. But while indispensable to the lawyer, it
will also prove a valuable vade mecum to the statesman and the
historian.

  INTRODUCTION.
This is a compilation of the laws and political documents of
Texas from the beginning of the Mexican Republic to the present
year.
As rights rest upon even obsolete laws, no distinction is here
made between laws obsolete and laws in force. From the scope of
the publication, its importance can readily be seen.
The advantage to the legal profession in Texas of having the
laws, general and special, of all the sessions, regular and special,
of our law-making bodies published in uniform style and conveni-
ent form, as herein presented, can not well be overestimated.
And in further enhancement of the work, it may be stated that
these published laws are exact copies of the authenticated origi-
nals in the Department of State at Austin.
Of importance second only to the laws themselves, are the jour-
nals and declarations classed under the general head of political
documents. The existence of many of these is not generally
known even to intelligent men; while others are just brought
again to light, after a long disappearance from public view. These
are essentially the connecting links of our legal and political his-
tory, scarcely less useful to lawyers than to statesmen using their
law knowledge in connection with political services, like Webster,
or as a basis of political philosophy, like Jefferson. Not a hetero-
geneous mass, but a related whole, this compilation is the ethical
expression of the period covered, or more plainly speaking', the
prevailing idea of right and wrong as applied to the social compact.
All knowledge of Texas as a self-governing community, apart
from these documents, must necessarily be superficial and unsat-
isfactory. In recognition of the principle, all historians of Texas
draw more or less from these materials; but generally too little,
and that in garbled form.
(As might naturally be expected from her origin and frequent
changes of dominion, Texas, of all the States in the American
Union, has the most complex history, legal and political. Passing
over the early and long continued struggle between France and
Spain for the mastery in Texas, it only concerns us to know that
France left us no laws, and that the rich inheritance of the Spanish

introduction.
Civil law has come down to us through connection with Mexico,.
But it was not till the coming- of the Anglo-American that respect-
ability attached to Texas and heroism to her history. And this
compilation begins with the advent of Austin to Texas, during the
expiring’ agonies of Spanish dominion in Mexico.
First in order among the documents here presented is Austin’s
Spanish colonization grant, ratified by the Constituent Congress
of Mexico, and then the still more important work of that august
body, “The Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States,”
more commonly known in Texas as the “Constitution of 1824,”
and that followed by the Constitution and Laws of Coahuila and
Texas, including the colonization law of Tamaulipas and those of
Texas.
As to the documents of the revolution, the Ordinances and De-
crees of the Consultation, including the declaration of the causes
for taking up arms against Santa Anna, the establishment of the
Provisional Government, with its Journal of Proceedings, and
the Ordinances and Decrees of the Convention at Washington, in-
cluding the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Jour-
nal of Proceedings, are all given.
The war of Texas, aided and to be aided by other Mexican
States, was for the maintenance of the Constitution of 1824, the
rough draft of which appears to have been prepared by S. F.
Austin. Abandoned in the contest by her Mexican confederates,
Texas finally struck ■ successfully for independence—a boon not
anticipated at the beginning of the struggle. A decade of inde-
pendence was enough for Texas.
In due order follows:
The Constitution of 1845, with the annexation resolution and
ordinance ratifying the same, bringing Texas into the Union, and
Constitution of the United States then become the supreme law
of the land.
The ordinances and decrees of the Secession Convention on
withdrawal of Texas from the Union, with the Constitution of the
Confederate States succeeding that of the United States as the
paramount law, 1861-65.
The ordinances and decrees of the Union Convention, 1866, on
the fall of the Confederacy, with amended Constitution of the
State, etc.
Reconstruction Act of Congress, March, 1867.
Ordinances and decrees of the Reconstruction Convention, 1868
-69.
The Constitution of 1876, with amendments and attendant
documents.%

And all the laws and resolutions passed under the preceding-
Constitutions.
From the foregoing it appears that we have had four organic
laws in Texas, to-wit:
The Mexican Constitution of 1824, in force about one decade;
federal, and paramount to the State Constitution of Coahuila and
Texas.
The Constitution of the Republic of Texas, in force about one
decade, and central; Texas having abolished the departments and
become “one and indivisible.”
The Constitution of the United States, in force about one and
one-half decades; federal, and paramount to that of Texas.
Supplanted by the Constitution of the Confederate States for
one-half a decade, and then restored and in force about three
decades.
With this sum total of the laws, and access to the reports of the
courts of last resort, one should only have the usual elementary
works for the foundation of a good working Texas law library.
In conclusion, it only remains to add that these volumes are in the
nature of original evidence for the student of our jurisprudence,
and that nowhere else can it be so well studied as to its origin,
character, successive changes, and its present status as a blend-
ed system of the Roman Civil Law and the Common Law of Eng-
land.
