bill a commission has issued, and by that body demanded and taken
from my secretary before it was recorded in my office. Also two cm-nmis-
sions certified in that bill to have been returned, one to McKinney &
Williams made out by the previous Council of which E. R. Royall was
president. And also one other commission made out by me to Thomas F.
McKinney, both for the same amount of one hundred thousand dollars.
These are Executive papers and belong to my office, you will also demand
and bring me the terms on which the armed vessel Invincible has been
tendered and accepted by the Government. You will further notify them
that if these things are not promptly complied with and they immedi-
ately desist from their injurious and disorganizing operations that I will
immediately order their arrest and transmission to the post of Bexar to
be tried by martial law.
You will immediately make to me your report.
