a duty. The protection of our liberties—one natural and re-
served right to make it so:—arms are the resort, and in arms
the people will find their only security from the oppression
of ambitious tyrants, whose chains are forged to manacle our
citizens and subdue them to their will: courage and bravery in
resistance, and prudence in council will restore to us the nat-
ural sovereignty of all Governments:—one civil compact or
constitution is destroyed and another must be formed to guar-

or prudently administered, is at best uncertain and insecure—
permanency and strength should be the basis of all Govern-

Be it resolved, That in virtue of the powers vested in the
“Provisional Government of Texas” by the Representatives
of the people in convention assembled, and it is hereby re-
solved, by the General Council of the Provisional Government
aforesaid, that a Convention of delegates of the people for
each Municipality of the three departments of Texas shall be
called, to assemble on the first day of March next, at the town
of Washington.
Sec. 2. Be it further resolved, That the Delegates elected
by the people be clothed with ample, unlimited, or plenary
powers as to the form of government to be adopted: provided,
that no Constitution formed shall go into effect, until the
same be submitted to the people and confirmed by a majority
thereof, in such manner as shall be prescribed by a provision ■
in such instrument.
Sec. 3. Be it further resolved, That the acting Judge, or in
case there be no acting Judge, the Alcalde of each municipal-
ity be required, and it is hereby made his duty to issue writs
of election to some competent and respectable citizen of each
election district, to hold the election in the said district on
the first day of February, 1836, to be conducted in the man-
ner that elections have heretofore been conducted—allowing
all free white males and Mexicans opposed to a Central Gov-
ernment a vote: provided, that no proxy votes shall be re-
ceived—excepting, nevertheless, all the Citizen Volunteers in
the Army, each of whom shall have a right to his vote, which
he shall write upon paper over his own proper signature,
