INTRODUCTION AND PREPARATORY NOTE.
A devotion to written Constitutions, and a strict adherence to their
literal interpretation, has been one of the most distinguishing political
'characteristics of all Anglo-Americans. Under the influence of this sen-
timent, the Colonies of Texas, composed principally of emigrants from
" The United States or America,” were—by repeated violations of
their chartered rights, experienced in the bosom of their immediate so-
ciety; as well as a general disregard of the Constitution, by the agents of
the Federal Government—naturally driven to unite in defence of that
sacred instrument: and to second the efforts of the patriotic projectors of
The Plan OF Vera CRUZ, so far at least, as to extripate, within the
limits of their community, every unlawful obstacle to their enjoyment,
and to establish the security of their imprescriptable rights. The people
having taken up arms and effected this, the heads of the chief political

TO THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS:

of confusion, which might materially affect the public tranquillity.
The late occurrences have been grossly misrepresented by the enemies
of Texas, and efforts have been made, and are continually making, to
prejudice our fellow-citizens, in other parts of the Mexican Republic,
against the people of Texas, by circulating reports that the object of the
late events was to declare this country independent of Mexico, which is
absolutely false and without any foundation in truth.
The Indians have commenced depredations on the frontiers of the Riv-
ers Brazos, Colorado, Guadalupe, and San Antonio; and the scattered
situation of the settlements, imperiously requires that some measures
should be adopted for their security.
There are, indeed, many subjects, connected with the welfare of Texas,
which ought to be laid before the Constitutional Authorities of the Mexi-
-can Nation: and these considerations of safety to ourselves, respect for the
-character of the people of Texas, the motives which have influenced them,
and the sanctity of the cause of the Constitution, as proclaimed in Vera
■Cruz, which we have espoused, have induced the Civil Authorities of the
