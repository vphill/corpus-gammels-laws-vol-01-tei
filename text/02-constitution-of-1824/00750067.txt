present it is only necessary to remark, that the constant assaults of pa-
triotism having broken the chain which united us to Spain, there could
remain no other centre of union, no other connecting link between the
different provinces of this great nation, but the leader who had induced
all the towns to pronounce their independence. An impartial world will
judge of the events which induced him to place himself at the head of a
second revolution, and of his tragical end; but the fact is certain, that the
State was dissolved by the fall of this unfortunate man, and that noth-
ing could restrain the revolution of the provinces; none possessed supe-
riority over the other; and the ship of state would have been wrecked
by the pitiless storm, if the wisdom and prudence, with which the people
hastened to convoke the former Congress, had not given the nation a
new existence. Congress could not fail to attend to the wishes of a na-
tion which had just given so striking a proof of its intelligence, and the
deputies could not vote against the wishes of their constituents. Never
have the legislators of any nation had a clearer manifestation of public
opinion to direct their deliberations, and never will the representatives of
any people find themselves in a more favorable situation of knowing the
desires of those from whom they received their mandate; and your depu-
ties will retire to the bosom of their families, with the pleasing satisfac-
tion of having labored in the spirit, and agreeably to the necessities of
their constituents.
To create a firm and free government, without its being dangerous to
the people; to place the Mexican nation in the rank which it ought to
hold among civilised nations, and enable it to exercise the influence to
which it is entitled by its situation, its population, and its wealth; to
make all equal before the law; to create peace without disorder; peace
without oppression; justice without rigor; clemency without weakness;
to mark the limits of the supreme auhorities of the nation; to combine
them in such a manner that their union shall always be productive of
good, and render evil impossible; to regulate the march of the legislature,
sheltering it at the same time from precipitation and error; to arm the
executive power with sufficient power and dignity to make it respected in
the interior, and deserving every consideration from foreigners; to secure
to the judiciary such an independence, that it will never create fears in
the breast of the innocent, and still less afford the hope of impunity to
the guilty; all this is in effect difficult, and here you perceive, Mexicans,
the sublime objects to which your General Congress has aspired in the
Constitution, which it presents to you. It has, however, not the pre-
sumption to think, that it has completely satisfied all your expectations;
but it flatters itself, that you will view with indulgence the numerous
errors which the weakness of its abilities may have stamped upon it, in
consideration of the zeal of the virtuous, of wise patriots engaged in
framing it, in the very short space of eleven months allowed them.
Your representatives, in meeting in the hall of their sessions, take with
them the wishes of the people, expressed with unanimity and energy.
The voice of the Federal Republic has made itself heard from every cor-
ner of the republic; and the public desire for this form of government
has explained itself so generally, and with as much force as it explained
itself in favor of independence. Your deputies therefore entertained no
doubt on this subject, as to the desires of the nation. Nevertheless cir-
cumspection, which ought to guide all legislators, required that they
