Proceedings of the General Council.

That it is not the design of this House to pass any ordinance or decree
to operate as an ex post facto law, or by any movement to surprize those
upon whom their decrees and ordinances are intended to operate, and
although their proceeding have been governed by emergencies; yet it has
been the especial care of the Council to avoid,' in their enactments, the
adoption of any measures, that might operate unequally. And most
especially have they, and will they, avoid the adoption of such measures,
as might effect most prejudicially, those who are most active in the coun-
try’s service, and deserve most at their country’s hands. And your com-
mittee feel themselves fully authorized to say, that whenever this House
discerns that any of its acts have, or are likely to have this tendency and
effect, they will, without hesitation, relieve by immediate counter-action.
It seems however, from the communication referred, that the case’ there
complained of, is just such an one, as it has been the object of the Coun-
cil to guard against, and calls for, and deserves the immediate interposi-
tion and relief of this House.
The circumstances as gathered from the letter referred, are that before
the passage, by this House, of an ordinance laying imposts and tonnage,
and before it was even in contemplation McKinney & Williams had gone
abroad, as had been their custom, to purchase and import their supplies
of goods and merchandize, and in full time to have them imported before
the passage of the impost and tonnage laws; but being detained, in con-
sequence of the difficulties in which the country was involved, and de-
layed too by their engagements in her behalf; in procuring arms and
vessels for her defence, the ordinance was passed, and their stock of
merchandize much larger than usual, in consequence of the increased de-
mand of the country, are now subject to heavy duties. While other mer-
chants more attentive to their own immediate interests, than their coun-
try’s weal, have escaped the consequences of the law.
Your committee, therefore, respectfully advise that the Government
interpose in behalf of McKinney & Williams in this instance, and that
they be released from the payment of the duties imposed by said law, as
regards their present importations; and for that purpose your committee
would respectfully submit the accompanying ordinance, &c.
The ordinance accompanying the above report was read the first time,
and the rule suspended, when it was read a second and third time, when
the question was taken on its final passage, and decided in the affirmative.
The same committee, through their chairman, Mr. Barrett, also made
the following report, which was read and adopted:
To the Honorable President and members of the General Council:
Your committee on state and judiciary, to whom was referred the pro-
ceeding of the volunteers of Goliad, in favor of independence, and the
proceedings of a public meeting held at Texana, upon the same subject—•
Report, that the free expression of opinion in all matters of Govern-
ment, is a right unquestioned among a free people, but when opinions
become declarations, solemnly adopted by a few, adverse to the principles,
and in their execution destructive to the very existence of the Govern-
ment, the right of free discussion is transcended, and the safety of a
whole community jeoparded, by the premature acts of a small part. The
