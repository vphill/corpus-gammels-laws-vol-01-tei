consideration and respect.
The following resolution was ordered to be entered:

powers of a government, and made a demand for the archives of this
body, we deem it a duty to yield to that call, and surrender our trust
into their hands, although not in accordance with the provisions of the
organic law, yet we are confident that an apology for this course will be
found in the present distracted state of public affairs, and a wish on our
part to do all in our power, to promote union and concert of action in
the defence of our beloved country against her merciless invaders.
When the Council adjourned sine die
