DECREE No. 91.
The Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas, taking into view the
declining state of its internal trade, caused mostly by the arrival
of foreigners in the market, and wishing to prevent as far as possible
the ruin of those of their constituents who are engaged in this occupa-
tion, find their business rendered ineffectual, also to encourage their
trade—has thought proper to decree as follows:
Art. 1. Foreign merchants, of whatever nation, not naturalized in
the republic of Mexico, are hereby prohibited from retailing goods
