which said acts are contrary to articles fourth, twelfth, and fif-
teenth of the laws of 1824 of the general congress of Mexico, and
one of said acts, for that cause has, by said general congress of
Mexico, been declared null and void: It is hereby declared that
the said act of 1834, in favor of John T. Mason, and of the 14th
of .March, 1835, of the said legislature of Coahuila and Texas,
and each and every grant founded thereon, is, and was from the
beginning, null and void; and all surveys made under pretence
of authority derived from said acts, are hereby declared to be
null and void: and all eleven league claims, located within twenty
leagues of the boundary line between Texas and the United States
of America, which have been located contrary to the laws of Mex-
ico, are hereby declared to be null and void. And whereas many
surveys and titles to lands have been made whilst most of the peo-
ple of Texas were absent from home, serving in the campaign
against Bexar, it is hereby declared that all the surveys and loca-
tions of land made since the act of the late consultation closing
the land offices, and all titles to land made since that time, are,
and shall be null and void.
And whereas the present unsettled state of the country and the
general welfare of the people demand that the operations of the
land office, and the whole land system shall be suspended until
persons serving in the army can have a fair and equal chance with
those remaining at home, to select and locate their lands, it is here-
by declared, that no survey or title which may hereafter be made
shall be valid, unless such survey or title shall be authorized by this
convention, or some future congress of the republic. And with a view
to the simplification of the land system, and the protection of the
people and the government from litigation and fraud, a general
land office shall be established, where all the land titles of the
republic shall be registered, and the whole territory of the republic
shall, he sectionized, in a manner hereafter to be prescribed by law,
which shall enable the officers of the government or any citizen,
to ascertain with certainty the lands that are vacant, and those
lands which may be covered with valid titles.
Sec. 11. Any amendment or amendments to this consti-
tution, may be proposed in the house of representatives or senate,
and if the same shall be agreed to by a majority of the members
elected to each of the two houses, such proposed amendment or
amendments shall be entered on the journals, with the yeas and
nays thereon, and referred to the congress then next to be chosen,
and shall be published for three months previous to the elec-
