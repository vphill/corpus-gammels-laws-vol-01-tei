And all the laws and resolutions passed under the preceding-
Constitutions.
From the foregoing it appears that we have had four organic
laws in Texas, to-wit:
The Mexican Constitution of 1824, in force about one decade;
federal, and paramount to the State Constitution of Coahuila and
Texas.
The Constitution of the Republic of Texas, in force about one
decade, and central; Texas having abolished the departments and
become “one and indivisible.”
The Constitution of the United States, in force about one and
one-half decades; federal, and paramount to that of Texas.
Supplanted by the Constitution of the Confederate States for
one-half a decade, and then restored and in force about three
decades.
With this sum total of the laws, and access to the reports of the
courts of last resort, one should only have the usual elementary
works for the foundation of a good working Texas law library.
In conclusion, it only remains to add that these volumes are in the
nature of original evidence for the student of our jurisprudence,
and that nowhere else can it be so well studied as to its origin,
character, successive changes, and its present status as a blend-
ed system of the Roman Civil Law and the Common Law of Eng-
land.
