Constitution of the Republic of Texas.
every single man of the age of seventeen and upwards, shall he
entitled to the third part of one league of land. All citizens who
may have previously to the adoption of this constitution, received
their league of land as heads of families, and their quarter of a
league of land as single persons, shall receive such additional quan-
tity as will make the quantity of land received by them equal to
one league and labor, and one third of a league, unless by bargain,
sale, or exchange, they have transferred or may henceforth transfer
their right to said land, or a portion thereof, .to some other citizen
of the republic: and in such case, the person to whom such right
shall have been transferred shall be entitled to the same, as fully
and amply as the person making the transfer might or could have
been.—No alien shall hold land in Texas, except by titles emanating
directly from the government of this republic. But if any citizen
of this republic should die intestate or otherwise, his children or
heirs shall inherit his estate, and aliens shall have a reasonable time
to take possession of and dispose of the same, in a manner here-
after to be pointed out by law. Orphan children whose parents
were entitled to land under the colonization laws of Mexico,
and who now reside in the republic, shall be entitled to all the
rights of which their parents were possessed at the time of their
death. The citizens of the republic shall not be compelled to reside
on the land, but shall have their lines plainly marked.
All orders of survey legally obtained by any citizen .of the repub-
lic, from any legally authorized- commissioner, prior to the act of
the late consultation closing the land offices, shall be valid. In all
cases the actual settler and occupant of the soil shall be entitled,
in locating his land, to include his improvement, in preference to
all other claims not acquired previous to his settlement, according
to the law of the land and this constitution—provided, that noth-
ing herein contained shall prejudice the rights of any other citizen
from whom a settler may hold land by rent or lease.
And whereas, the protection of the public domain from un-
just and fraudulent claims, and quieting the people in the enjoy-
ment of their lands, is one of the great duties of this convention;
and whereas the legislature of Coahuila and Texas having pass-
ed an act in the year 1834, in behalf of general John T. Mason
of New York, and another on the 14th day of March, 1835, un-
der which the enormous amount of eleven hundred leagues of
land has been claimed by sundry individuals, some of whom re-
side in foreign countries, and are not citizens of the republic,—
