AN ACT
To authorize attachments to be issued in certain cases therein
named.
Whereas many Mexicans residing upon our frontier stole and
drove off large herds of cattle, and took and carried off other prop-
erty belonging to citizens of this republic, and whereas those Mexi-
cans have abandoned the country, and removed beyond the Eio
Grande, so that persons from whom they have taken property are
wholly without remedy:
Sec. 1. Be it therefore enacted, by the senate and house of
representatives of the republic of Texas in congress assembled,
That in all cases it shall be lawful for any person, from whom prop-
erty was wrongfully taken, to sue out an attachment upon filing an
affidavit, stating to the best of his or her belief the value of such
property, and that to the best of his or .her belief the same was
taken by the person against whom such attachment is prayed, and
that the said party resides out of the jurisdiction of the court, so
that an action cannot be prosecuted against them; which said at-
tachment may be levied by the sheriff of the proper county, upon
the property, both real and personal of the defendant.
