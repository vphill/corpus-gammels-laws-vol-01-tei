DECEEE No. 133.

by the chief agent of the state rents through the channel of the ex-
ecutive; has thought proper to decree:

the words June and July shall be inserted instead of those of August
and September.

cree No. 44 of the 21st of February, 1828, and of those which may
hereafter occur so as entirely to defeat the fulfilment thereof, so far
as it has to do with the national rent, has thought proper to decree:

tal of the district of Rio Grande.
