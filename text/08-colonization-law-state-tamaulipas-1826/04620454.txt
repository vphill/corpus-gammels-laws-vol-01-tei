OF
THE STATE OF TAMAULIPAS.
[No. 42.]
December 15th, 1826.
The Congress of the State of Tamaulipas enacts the following as a
General Law.
Article 1. Foreigners, who wish to colonize vacant lands in the state,
shall be admitted, and their persons and property protected provided they
submit to the laws of the republic, and those, of the State.
Art. 2. For a foreigner to obtain adjudication of lands he must be-
come domiciliated in some town in the state with a capital of his own to
afford him a decent support, or with a trade or useful industrious pursuit
which he follows; or he must establish a new town with one hundred fam-
ilies at least. Should he establish himself on the northern frontier of the
state, fifty families shall be sufficient for that purpose.
Art. 3. In either case they shall make their petitions in writing to
the governor of the state, who shall resolve thereon with the concurrence
of his council, and audience of the fiscal of the court, of justice of the
state, making them the concessions of lands that shall be hereinafter de-
termined.
Art. 4. Foreigners who claim domiciliation in any of the present
towns, their petition being granted by the executive, shall be sworn by
the respective political authority to observe and to comply with the con-
stitutive act, the constitution and laws of the republic, and those of the
state.
Art. 5. After this act, the said authority shall provide that, in a book
to be denominated Register of Foreigners, shall be written the name of
the person who shall have taken the oath, mentioned in the foregoing
article, whether he be married, his age, trade, and place of his birth,
setting down also the names of the family he may have, and making rela-
tion of having taken the oath prescribed. Said books shall be kept in the
archives of each town.
