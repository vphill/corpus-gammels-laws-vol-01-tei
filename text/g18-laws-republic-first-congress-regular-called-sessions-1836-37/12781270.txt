Laws of the Republic of Texas.
the jury as to the weight of evidence in any cause civil or criminal,
but such judge may sum up the testimony, and shall charge the
jury as to any matter of law arising thereon, and the judge of any
district court may at his discretion, in any criminal case, reserve a
question of law, which to him may appear novel or difficult, for
the consideration and discretion of the supreme court at the next
succeeding term, and the supreme court shall pronounce such sen-
tence or judgment as the district court ought to have pronounced.
Sec. 44. It shall be the duty of the judge of any court to cause
the judgment, sentence or decree of the court to be carried into
execution agreeably to law.
Sec. 45. When by appeal or otherwise a case shall be taken from
the district court to the supreme-court, the clerk of the district
court shall immediately make up a full and perfect record of all
proceedings in such case, and shall, on the application of either
party, give to such party an attested copy of such record, with a
taxation of all costs that have accrued thereon, and shall endorse
on such copy the day on which it was demanded, and the day on
which it is delivered, and sign his name as clerk thereto; and if by
reason of the delay or neglect of any clerk to give a transcript of
the record, in any case aforesaid, the same shall not be filed in the
supreme court in due time, or if the record be erroneously or incor-
rectly made up, so that the supreme court cannot proceed thereon
to a final decision, such clerk shall in either case, upon conviction
thereof, before any court of competent jurisdiction, be adjudged
guilty of a misdemeanor in office, and shall be fined in a sum not
exceeding two hundred dollars, for the use of the party entitled
to such attested copy, and shall moreover be liable to an action
for all damages the said party may sustain on account of said
neglect or delay, provided, that if the supreme court shall think
there is sufficient matter of substance in the record and proceed-
ings, on any appeal or otherwise, to enable them to proceed to a
final decision, the same shall not be dismissed for want of form,
and in all cases where the supreme court shall be of opinion, that
any appeal has been taken for delay, and that the party appeal-
ing had no probable good and sufficient reason for taking such
appeal, then, in that case, the party appealing, if he be the de-
fendant in the court below, shall be taxed ten per cent, damages,
to the use and benefit of the plaintiff in the court below, besides
interest, and cost of suit.
