Proceedings of the Convention at Washington.
On motion of Mr. Gazley,
The report was received and unanimously agreed to.
On motion of Mr. Collingsworth,
Resolved, That Mr. Willis A. Faris be allowed to take a seat at
the secretary’s table, to note and report the proceedings of the
Convention, and
The question being taken thereon, it was decided in the affirma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive.

On motion of Mr. Potter,
Resolved, That a committee be appointed consisting of one mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber
from each municipality represented in the Convention, for
the purpose of drafting a Constitution for Texas, and that the
same be reported as soon as practicable to this Convention.
And the question being taken thereon, it was decided in the
affirmative; whereupon the President appointed Messrs. Parmer,
Potter, Stewart, Waller, Grimes, Coleman, Fisher, Bunton, Gaines,
Zavala, Everett, Hardeman, Stepp, Crawford, West, Powers, Na<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />varro,
McKinney, Menifee, Mottley, and Menard, said committee.
The committee to whom was assigned the duty of drafting a
Declaration of Independence, through their chairman, Mr. Chil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dress,
made the following
EEPORT.
When a government has ceased to protect the lives, liberty and
property of the people, from whom its legitimate powers are de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rived,
and for the advancement of whose happiness it was insti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tuted;
and so far from being a guarantee for the enjoyment of
those inestimable and inalienable rights, becomes an instrument
in the hands of evil rulers for their oppression. When the Fed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Republican Constitution of their country, which they have
sworn to support, no longer has a substantial existence, and the
whole nature of their government has been forcibly changed, with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
their consent, from a restricted federative republic, composed
of sovereign states, to a consolidated, central, military despotism,
in which every interest is disregarded but that of the army and
priesthood; both the eternal enemies of civil liberty, the ever ready
minions of power, and the usual instruments of tyrants. When,
long after the spirit of the constitution is departed, moderation is,
at length, so far lost by those in power, that even the semblance
of freedom is removed, and the forms themselves of the constitution
discontinued; and so far from their petitions and remonstrances
being regarded, the agents who bear them are thrown into dun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />geons;
and mercenary armies sent forth to force a new government
upon them at the point of the bayonet. When, in consequence of
such acts of mal-feasance and abdication, on the part of the gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
anarchy prevails and civil society is dissolved into its origi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />(834)

nal elements. In such a crisis, the first law of nature, the right
of self-preservation, is the inherent and inalienable right of the
people to appeal to first principles, and take their political affairs
into their own hands in extreme cases, enjoins it as a right towards
themselves, and a sacred obligation to their posterity to abolish
such government and create another in its stead, calculated to res<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cue
them from impending dangers, and to secure their future wel<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fare
and happiness.
Nations, as well as individuals, are amenable for their acts, to
the public opinion of mankind. A statement of a part of our
grievances is, therefore, submitted to an impartial world, in justi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fication
of the hazardous, but unavoidable, step now taken of sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ering
our political connexions with the Mexican people, and as-'
suming an independent attitude among the nations of the earth.
The Mexican government, by its colonization laws, invited and
induced the Anglo-American population of Texas to colonize its
wilderness under the pledged faith of a written constitution, that
they should continue to enjoy that constitutional liberty and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />publican
government, to which they had been habituated in the
land of their birth, the United States of America. In this ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pectation
they have been cruelly disappointed, inasmuch as the
Mexican nation has acquiesced in the late changes made in the .
government by general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who, having
overturned the constitution of his country, now offers us the cruel
alternative, either to abandon our homes, acquired by so many pri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vations,
or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny, the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bined
despotism of the sword and the priesthood.
It hath sacrificed our welfare to the state of Coahuila, by which
our interests have been constitutionally depressed through a jealous
and partial course of legislation, carried on at a far distant seat of
government, by a hostile majority, in an unknown tongue; and this
too, notwithstanding we have petitioned, in the humblest terms,
for the establishment of a separate state government, and have, in
accordance with the provisions of the national constitution, pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sented
to the general congress a republican constitution, which
was, without just cause, contemptuously rejected.
It incarcerated in a dungeon, for a long time, one of our citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens,
for no other cause but a zealous endeavor to procure the ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceptance
of our constitution, and the establishment of a state gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment.

It. has failed and refused to secure, on a firm basis, the right of
trial by jury, that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guaran<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee
for the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.
It has failed to establish any public system of education, although
possessed of almost boundless resources, (the public domain) and.
although it is an axiom in political science, that unless a people are

Proceedings of the Convention at Washington.
educated and enlightened, it is idle to expect the continuance of
civil liberty, or the capacity for self government.
It has suffered the military commandants, stationed among us,
to exercise arbitrary acts of oppression and tryanny; thus trampling
upon the most sacred rights of the citizen, and rendering the mili<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tary
superior to the civil power.
It has dissolved, by force of arms, the state congress of Coahuila
and Texas, and obliged our representatives to fly for their lives
from the seat of government, thus depriving us of the fundamental
political right of representation.
It has demanded the surrender of a number of our citizens, and
ordered military detailments to seize and carry them into the in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terior
for trial, in contempt of the civil authorities, and in defiance
of the laws and the constitution.
It has made piratical attacks upon our commerce, by commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioning
foreign desperadoes, and authorizing them to seize our
vessels, and convey the property of our citizens to far distant ports
for confiscation.
It denies us the right of worshipping the Almighty, according to
the dictates of our conscience, by the support a national religion,
calculated to promote the temporal interest of its human func<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tionaries,
rather than the glory of the true and living God.
It has demanded us to deliver up our arms, which are essential
to our defence, the rightful property of freemen, and formidable
only to tyrannical government.
It has invaded our country, both by land and sea, with intent
to lay waste our territory, and drive us from our homes; and has
now a large mercenary army advancing to carry on against us a
war of extermination.
It has, through its. emmissaries, incited the merciless savage,
with the tomahawk and scalping knife, to massacre the inhabitants
of our defenceless frontiers.
It hath been, during the whole time of our connection with it,
the contemptible sport and victim of successive military revolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions;
and hath continually exhibited every characteristic of a weak,
corrupt, and tyrannical government.
These, and other grievances, were patiently borne by the people
of Texas, until they reached that point at which forbearance ceased
to be a virtue. We then took up arms in defence of the national
constitution. We appealed to our Mexican brethren for assistance.
Our appeal has been made in vain. Though months have elapsed,
no sympathetic response has yet been heard from the interior. We
are, therefore, forced to the melancholy conclusion, that the Mex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ican
people have acquiesced in the destruction of their liberty, and
the substitution thereof of a military government; that they are
unfit to be free, and incapable of self-government. The necessity

of self-preservation, therefore, now decrees our eternal political sep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />aration.

We, therefore, the delegates, with plenary powers, of the people
of Texas, in solemn convention assembled, appealing to a candid
world for the necessities of our condition, do hereby resolve and
declare that our political connexion with the Mexican nation has
forever ended; and that the people of Texas.do now constitute a
free, sovereign and independent RepxMic, and are fully invested
with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to inde<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pendent
nations; and conscious of the rectitude of our intentions,
we fearlessly and confidently commit the issue to the supreme
biter of the destinies of nations.

the members being called and the journals of the two preceding
days being read by the Secretary,
Mr. Everitt, chairman of the committee on privileges and elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
made the following report:
Your committee on privileges and elections ask leave respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
to report, that after a patient examination of various docu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments
laid before your committee, in regard to an election held in
the municipality of Matagorda, (said election being contested by
Messrs. Royall and Fisher) have come to the conclusion that Mr.
S. Rhodes Fisher is legally elected and entitled to a seat in this
house. In drawing this conclusion, your committee would respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
state to the house, that among the returns of elections, is one
from Goliad, held among the volunteers on the fifth of January;
at that election Mr. Royall received sixteen votes. The person who
discharged that post, appeared before your committee, and testi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied
that he discharged said volunteers on the evening of the 11th

and morning of the 12th .January, and it appears further in evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence,
that a part at least of said volunteers voted again, and your
committee are unanimously of opinion, that said votes were not
legal votes, and that they ought not to be counted, and in making
up their report, they have left them entirely out.
It appears further in evidence that three men on their way from
, the army to the United States, did vote at a house where they
stopped for the night, and as is certified, their votes were taken
between the hours of 8 and 9 o’clock at night, your committee are
unanimously of opinion that the above three votes should not be
counted, as they were clearly illegal, and have accordingly thrown
them out, as said persons who so voted, did immediately thereafter
leave the country, and also that the votes were taken after the time
of the election.
Your committee are therefore of opinion, that Mr. S. Rhodes
Fisher, named, ought to be enrolled among the members of this
house.

C. B. STEWART, , Committee.
On motion of Mr. Rusk,
The report of the committee was received.
On motion of Mr. Childress,
Resolved, That inasmuch as there are two contested elections
pending before this Convention, viz: that election between Messrs.
McMullen and Bowers, and that between Messrs. Royall. and Fisher,
and inasmuch as there is, and will be, contradictory statements
and evidence before this body, and probably great uncertainty will
exist as to who ought to have the seats referred to, and inasmuch
as there is not time before the. probable adjournment of this body
to refer the questions back to the people for a new election, and
it is desirable that there should be a full representation of all the
people, and that the Convention should have the assistance of
the representations from those municipalities, and that all dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sentions
and irritating questions should now be entirely avoided,
Therefore, Resolved, through the plenary powers vested in this
Convention, that each of the above named. gentlemen be allowed
to take their seats as members of this body, that those who are
now here be allowed to do so immediately, and the others when<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever
they may appear and make their application.
Mr. Childress argued in favor of the resolution, Messrs. Rusk
and Potter in opposition, and the question being taken thereon
it was decided in the negative.
Mr. Legrand asked and obtained leave that Mr. Royall should
address the Convention in behalf of himself, which he did at some
length in defence of his right to a seat in the Convention.

Messrs. Rusk and Everett followed in support of the report made
by the committee on privileges and elections, and the question
being taken thereon, was decided in the affirmative.
Mr. Everett, Chairman of the Committee on privileges and elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions,
made the following report:
The committee of privileges and elections respectfully ask leave
to report that the Honl. John Turner came before said committee
and attested that his constituents instructed him to protest against
Mr. McMullen being received as a member of this Convention; that
the grounds on which the protest was founded, was that many
volunteers, who desired to vote on the day of election, were not
allowed to vote by a majority of the judges of the election; that
he heard at least four say that they intended to vote for Mr.
Bowers and he is clearly of opinion that many others would have
voted for Mr. Bowers. Your committee differ in opinion, and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spectfully
desire the sense of the house to be taken on it.
Your committee is fully of opinion that Mr. Bowers should be
invited to take a seat in this house.

an army in the field; and, whereas, it is also necessary that there
should be one Supreme head or Commander in Chief, and due de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />grees
of subordination defined, established and strictly observed,
Therefore, be it Resolved, that General Samuel Houston be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed

that he forthwith proceed to take command, establish head<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quarters
and organize the army accordingly.

The Convention adjourned until 2 o’clock P. M.

The Convention met pursuant to adjournment.
On motion of Mr. Collinsworth,
The resolution laid on the table until two o’clock, being called
for, and the house sustaining the call, and the resolution being
read by the secretary, Mr. Gazley offered the following amend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment:

And that Samuel Houston retain such command until the elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion

however, to the general orders of the government de facto, until

SUNDAY, MARCE 6, 1836.
The President called the Convention together, and informed
them that he had received by express, a letter from Colonel W.
Barrett Travis, Commandant of the Alamo, at Bejar de San An<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tonio,
which required the immediate action of the Convention. The
letter being read by the secretary, was as follows, to wit:
COMMANDANOY op the Alamo, )
Bejar, March 3d, 1836.	9
Sib: In the present confusion of the political authorities of
the country, and in the absence of the commander-in-chief, I beg
leave to communicate to you the situation of this garrison. You
have doubtless already seen my official report of the action of the
twenty-fifth ult., made on that day to Gen. Sam. Houston, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether
with the various communications heretofore sent by ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />press,
I shall therefore confine myself to what has transpired since
that date.
From the twenty-fifth to the present date, the enemy have kept
up a bombardment from two howitzers, (one a five and a half inch,
and the other an eight inch,) and a heavy cannonade from two long
nine pounders, mounted on a battery on the opposite side of the
river, at a distance of four hundred yards from our walls. During
this period the enemy have been busily employed in encircling us
with entrenched encampments on all sides, at the following dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tance,
to wit: In Bejar, four hundred yards west; in Lavilleta,
three hundred yards south; at the powder house, one thousand
yards east by south; on the ditch, eight hundred yards north east,
and at the old mill, eight hundred yards north. Notwithstanding
all this, a company of thirty-two men from Gonzales, made their
way into us on the morning of the first inst. at three o’clock, and
Colonel J. B. Bonham (a courier from Gonzales) got in this morn<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
at eleven o’clock, without molestation. I have fortified this
place, so that the walls are generally proof .against cannon balls;
and I still continue to entrench on the inside, and strengthen the
walls by throwing up the dirt.
At least two hundred shells have
fallen inside of our works without having injured
a single man;
indeed we have been so fortunate as not to loose a man from any
cause, and we have killed many of the enemy. The spirits of my
men are still high, although they have had much to depress them.
We have contended for ten days against an enemy whose numbers
are variously estimated at from fifteen hundred to six thousand
men, with. General Ramier Siesma and Colonel Batris, the aid
de camp of Santa Anna, at their head. A report was circulated
that Santa Anna himself was with the enemy, but I think it was
false. A reinforcement of about one thousand men is now en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tering
Bejar, from the west, and I think it more than probable
that Santa Anna is now in town, from the rejoicing we hear.
( 845)</p><pb n="846" xml:id="P0846" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/854/" /><p>26
Proceedings of the Convention at Washington.
Col. Fannin is said to be on the march to this place with re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />inforcements,
but I fear it is not true, as I have repeatedly sent
to him for aid without receiving any. Col. Bonham, my special
messenger, arrived at La - Bahia fourteen days ago, with a request
for aid; and on the arrival of the enemy in Bejar, ten days ago, I
sent an express to Colonel F., which arrived at Goliad on the next
day, urging him to send us reinforcements; none have yet arrived.
I look to the colonies alone for aid; unless it arrives soon, I shall
have to fight the enemy on his own terms. I will, however, do
the best I can under the circumstances; and I feel confident that
the determined valor and desperate courage, heretofore exhibited
by my men, will not fail them in the last struggle; and although
they may be sacrifice! to the vengence of a Gothic enemy, the vic<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tory
will cost the enemy so dear, that it will be worse for him than
a defeat. I hope your honorable body will hasten on reinforce<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments,
ammunition, and provisions to our aid as soon as possible.
We have provisions for twenty days for the men we have. Our
supply of ammunition is limited. At least five hundred pounds
of cannon powder, and two hundred rounds of six, nine, twelve
and eighteen pound balls, ten kegs of rifle powder and a supply of
lead, should be sent to the place without delay, under a sufficient
guard.
If these things are promptly sent, and large reinforcements are
hastened to this frontier, this neighborhood will be the great and
decisive ground. The power of Santa Anna is to be met here, or
in the colonies; we had better meet them here than to suffer a war
of devastation to rage in our settlements. A blood red banner
waves from the church of Bejar, and in the camp above us, in token
that the war is one of vengence against rebels; they have declared
us as such; demanded that we should surrender at discretion, or
that this garrison should be put to the sword. Their threats have
had no influence on me or my men, but to make all fight with
desperation, and that high souled courage which characterises the
patriot, who is willing to die in defence of his country’s liberty and
his own honor.
The citizens of this municipality are all our enemies, except those
who have joined us heretofore. We have but three Mexicans now
in the fort; those who have not joined us, in this extremity, should
be declared public enemies, and their property should aid in pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the expenses of the war.
The bearer of this will give your honorable body a statement
more in detail, should he escape through the enemy’s lines.
God and Texas—Victory or Death.
Your obedient servant.
W. BARRETT TRAVIS, Lieut. Col. Comm.
P. S. The enemy’s troops are still arriving, and the reinforce<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
will probably amount to two or three thousand.

Proceedings of the Convention at Washington.
Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas, )
Washington, March 4, 1836.	5
To the Honl. the President,
and Members of the Convention:
Gentlemen,—Having been called upon by the constituted autho<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rities
of the country, to exercise the power, and discharge the du<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties
of Governor, according to the second article of the organic
law, which I have complied with much against my own inclination,
but in obedience to what I conceived to be my paramount duty
as Lieutenant Governor, the governor being suspended by the
competent authority. The right and authority under which I
exercised this power, and performed these duties, having been
called in question, and made the foundation of, and the excuse
for disobedience of orders in some instances, and doubt and in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />decision
in many, very many, highly respectable citizens, to the
manifest injury of our beloved country; and not wishing to claim
powers not clearly delegated, and unquestionably given by the
laws of the land, and sustained by the people of free and independent
Texas, I have presented the subject before you, for your considera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
and decision, and will bow with pleasure to whatever conclu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion
you may arrive. I know the tenacity with which the human
heart usually clings to power, and the exercise of a little brief
authority; but for myself I do unhesitatingly say that it was with
great reluctance that I entered upon the discharge of the guberna<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />torial
duties, and I assure you that I will retire from this situation
to the tented field, where I hope to render some service, however
humble, as a private soldier, and I trust I will meet every free<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />man
who can be spared from other public service. In this her
hour of peril and danger, Texas shall not find me wanting in de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />votion
to her interest and honor, and this pledge I am now ready
to redeem with my life.
Although I entertain no doubt of my right and duty to act as
the Executive of the Country and, in the words of a distinguished
statesman of the Land of Washington, “I challenge the test of
talents and of time” in regard to the purity of my intentions in
the administration of the government. The course I have pursued
is marked, clear and onward. In the last Convention to the
best of my abilities, independence, and nothing but independence,
had my unqualified support; and every days experience since that
time, satisfies me that a declaration of that .kind ought to have
been made, and any other declaration now, would utterly blast and
destroy with a fated mildew, the fond hopes of the friends of the
country, here and elsewhere. Yet for Texas I am, and ever have
been, ready to make any sacrifice in my power to offer, but that of
honor and my oath of office.
Permit me therefore to request your honorable body, so to or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganise,
constitute and remodel the provisional Government, as to
( 854)</p><pb n="855" xml:id="P0855" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/863/" /><p>Proceedings of the Convention at Washington.

restore harmony, promote union, provide for the common defence
and general welfare; and that the public interest may not be
prejudiced or injured by the present unhappy state of dissention
and disunion.
Allow me to urge upon you the necessity of doing so with as
little delay as your other imperative and urgent duties will per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mit,
and I would respectfully say, that I hold my official papers at
the disposition of the Convention.
We are now invaded by a ruthless enemy, who gives no quar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ters,
and conscious that a moment ought not to be lost in meeting
and repelling him, I will not attempt an argument of the question
of the propriety of such an organization; it must be too plain a
proposition to need it; and there is neither time nor place for cold
debate; but the times call for prompt and energetic action.
The kindness of friends, the confidence reposed, and the duty
I owe my country will not permit me to say less, and the urgent and
imploring call of our invaded homes will not allow me longer to
trespass upon your valuable time, that can otherwise be profitably
appropriated.
That Harmony may prevail in your councils, throughout all
your arduous labors, as it has in making an unqualified declaration
of Independence, and the formation of a Constitution thereon for
our Government may be the happy result, is the sincere hope of
your
Fellow citizen,
JAMES W. ROBINSON.
The President laid before the Convention a communication from
John McMullen, the late President pro-tern of the late General
Council, Alexander Thompson and G. A. Patillo, which being
read by the Secretary was as follows.
Council Room,
Washington, March 8, 1836.
To the Honl. the President and members of the Convention:
The undersigned members of the General Council, have under<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stood,
from some source, that the verbal notice given us a few days
since by a committee of your honorable body, that “the Conven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention
were organized,” was deemed a sufficient announcement
that the powers of the provisional Govt, had ceased. This, from
our understanding of the organic Law, we did not think to be the
case, nor that we could be relieved without some declaration on the
part of the Convention; accordingly, we replied verbally to your
Committee, that we were ready to deliver the archives of the
Council into the hands of the Convention, or any authority acting
as a Government, provisional or otherwise.
The unfortunate difficulties that arose between the different
branches of the provisional government, of which it is unneces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />(

sary to speak at this time, in some measure crippled its operations
an prevented it from acting with that energy so necessary in a
crisis like the present. This state of things, we expected, would
induce the convention to organize immediately, some temporary
authority to meet the present exigencies of the country.
We would not suppose that the convention superseded the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visional
government, without some declaration on their part of
such fact; if it is so deemed by your honorable body, or any au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thority
is designated to receive the archives, we are ready to de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />liver
them, and with pleasure return to our homes and the field.
John McMullen, <pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />Prest.
pro tem. of the Gen. Council.
ALEX. THOMPSON,
G. A. PATILLO.
On motion of Mr. Parmer,
The communications were referred to the committee on public
documents.
Mr. Potter introduced the following preamble and resolution:
Whereas, the securing to the people of Texas in the fair and un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />disturbed
enjoyment of their lands, is an object of paramount con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration
with this convention; and, whereas, certain designing
persons in Texas, combined with others who live in distant parts,
and are not citizens of Texas, are seeking, under the cover of
forgery or fraudulent grants, to cheat the people of Texas out of
large and valuable portions of their lands, which, if not put down,
would oppress the individual settlers, and cripple the resources of
the country, so as to put it out of the power of the government to
make suitable provisions in lands and otherwise for our volunteers
now in the field, or who may hereafter serve the public cause;
Therefore, Resolved, That the committee on the constitution,
be instructed to inquire into the propriety of inserting in that in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />strument
a provision to the following effect, viz: No claim of
eleven leagues of land or more shall be valid; and all titles issued
to any individual, under any pretence whatsoever, for more than
one League and a Labor of Land, (empresarios excepted) shall be
null and void and of no effect. All titles which may have been
issued to any individual, under any pretence whatsoever, since the
act of the late Consultation closing the Land offices, shall be null
and void and of no effect; and in the future adjustment of land
titles, not previously located by others, in accordance with the
principles of this provision, shall enjoy a preference over all other
persons. This Convention, or the Congress which may succeed it,
will make provisions for carrying this article into effect; and no
legislative act, or judicial decision shall ever be made in contra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diction
to the foregoing clause.

for more than the quantity of land established by the Colonization

proper.
Which lies on the table one day, under the rule of the house.

Mr. Collinsworth, chairman of the committee on public docu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments,
made the following report:
In regard to the loan contracted by your commissioners in the
United States, your committee are of opinion that it is not so ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vantageous
to this government as could have been'desired. But
when it is considered that the late consultation had declared for
the republican principles of the constitution of eighteen hundred
and twenty-four, which gave us no distinct national existence;
which declaration, however proper at the time, tended very much
to abate the enthusiasm felt in our behalf. And when it is fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ther
considered, that this fact alone rendered any security on Texas

extremely precarious, and that too, at a time when our national
existence depended upon the immediate reception of money, pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions
and arms, to carry on the war, your committee are satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied
that the loans submitted 'were the best that could have been
made under the circumstances.
Add to this the great importance of at all times preserving good
faith as a nation, your committee are of opinion that it is due to
your commissioners, and to yourselves, that the loans should be
unhesitatingly ratified.
Your committee having also had under consideration the treaty
made by your late commissioners, with the small tribes of Indians
specified in said treaty, are of opinion that said treaty is probably
as favorable as could have been made at the time under all the
circumstances, and recommends its ratification.
They have also had under consideration the proposition of John
T. Lamar, which proposition is herewith submitted as part of this
report, .and recommend its adoption.

Proceedings of the Convention at Washington.
On motion of Mr. Childress, the same was referred to the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitte
on military affairs.
On motion of Mr. Potter,
Resolved, That all persons (slaves and Indians excepted) residing
in Texas, on the day of the declaration of independence, shall be
considered as citizens of the republic, and entitled to all the privil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eges
as such. The citizens of Texas shall be entitled to, and are here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />by
confirmed in their lands, in the following manner and propor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions,
viz: every man of family shall be entitled to a league and
a labor of land, and every single man, of the age of twenty-one
years, shall be entitled to a third of a league of land; which several
portions of land, the persons entitled to the same, shall. be privi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />leged
to locate on any vacant lands; and all citizens now settled in
Texas, shall, in the location of their lands, be entitled to include
their settlement in preference over all other persons or claims, what<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever;
except those from whom such settler may have received his
settlement, by rent or lease; and it shall not be obligatory on the
settler, to live on his land, but he shall have the lines plainly
marked.
And, whereas, there is good reason to believe that many fraud<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ulent
grants of land, or grants the condition of which have never
been complied with, have been located in Texas: therefore,
Be it ordained, that the first congress which shall convene under
the constitution, shall- establish such tribunals as it in their wis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dom
may think proper to adjudicate and determine, without the
right of appeal or future litigation, the validity of the above men<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned
grants; provided, however, that in no case whatsoever, shall
any of the above mentioned grants interfere with the actual settler,
in the occupancy of the land, or being a citizen of Texas, may
rightfully claim it as his head right, under this constitution, or the
colonization laws of the Mexican government.
Provided, that nothing herein contained, shall deprive any citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zen
of Texas of rights already vested by the laws of the land. It
shall be the duty of congress to provide for the volunteers who
have so faithfully served Texas in the field, or who may hereafter
serve against the enemy, by ’setting apart so much of the most
valuable portions of the public lands, as will answer that purpose.
In the event of the death, without will, of any person entitled to
land under the constitution, or the colonization laws of Mexico,
his children, or next of kin, shall inherit his land, each and every
person holding or claiming land in Texas, either in their own
name or by agent, within six months from the date of the declara<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of independence, become citizens of this republic; and reside
during the war, within the limits of Texas, unless absent on pub- •
lie business, or on leave according to law; and in every case of
failure to comply with this requirement, the individual so failing
shall forfeit to the republic all interest, right and title, in and to,

all lands within the limits of Texas, whether’ claimed or owned
in their own, name, or by agent; nor shall any alien ever hold land
within the limits of Texas, whether claimed or owned in their
own name, or by agent.

pardon to persons convicted of crime, was by the late con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention,

relief, from the severity and extreme rigor of the law, in
peculiar cases, is an important, and sometimes a deeply interesting
function of government, which should never be permitted to lapse

the source of all power, who are incapable of the specific exercise

committee on the Constitution to correct errors and phraseology
of the same.
2. Mr. Fisher of Matagorda, chairman of committee on Naval
affairs made the following report on the African Slave trade.
“The committee to whom was referred a letter dated Velasco,
March 2d, 1836, from Wm. S. Fisher, Collector, beg leave to ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />serve,
that the subject matter of said letter is of such a nature as to •
involve several important legal questions, which your committee do
not consider come within the sphere of their duties; inasmuch as the
private rights of some of our valued and respected citizens are there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />in
involved. Yet your committee feel bound to give it as their opin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ion,
that the introduction of African Negroes, is in contravention of
the existing Treaties between most nations, and the existing laws of
this land. And your committee have no hesitancy in stating their
views and belief of the extreme impolicy of either covertly or di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rectly
countenancing a traffic, which has called forth the indignant
condemnation of nearly the whole civilized world. It is to that civ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ilized
world that we now, in our present struggle look for sympathy,
and hope from that sympathy to extract assistance.—Almost every
nation has proclaimed against this traffic many years since, and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nounced
it as “Piracy;” and we are bound to believe from the late
Message of his Majesty the King of Great Britain that, he has con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cluded
with Denmark, Sardinia and Sweden, new conventions cal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />culated
to prevent it, and was in expectation of receiving a rati<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fication
of a similar treaty with Spain—that he was engaged in
negotiating with other powers of Europe and South America for
similar purposes, and hopes ere long, the traffic will be entirely sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pressed.

Your committee therefore respectfully suggest that, as a nation
just ushered into existence, it most eminently becomes our duty
and policy to adapt our measures to the genius and spirit of the age.
We must be governed by the opinions of others—we must so regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />late
our infant steps as to deserve the kind and watchful solicitude
of older Nations. But while advocating the broad and abstract
■ principle of justice, let us not by taking a retrospective view, of a
doubtful and exciting question, interfere with or violate the just
rights of our citizens.
Your Committee therefore in presenting their individual and col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lective
views of the justice and policy of the Traffic in African Ne<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />groes,
would respectfully beg that your honorable body discharge
them from the further consideration of the subject, as being one
which does not properly come under their notice.”
On motion of Mr. Childress 1000 copies of the report were or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered

Mr. Ellis laid before the Convention a communication from Ed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ward
