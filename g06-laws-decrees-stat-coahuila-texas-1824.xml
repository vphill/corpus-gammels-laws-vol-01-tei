of December last, has thought proper to decree as follows:</p>

<p>A three per cent, duty of consumption shall, for the present, be estab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished
in the custom house of this capital, and the receiver’s office of
Parras only, upon foreign effects, upon the invoices made in the mari<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />time
custom houses at the time of the introduction thereof.</p>

<p>The Governor <emph rend="italic">ad interim</emph> of the State, for the fulfillment thereof, shall
cause the same to be published and circulated.</p>

<p>Given at Saltillo on the 15th of February, 1824.</p>

<head>DECREE No. 15.</head>

<p>The Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas has thought proper
to decree as follows:</p>

<p>ARTICLE 1. In the different places to which it belongs, and where
the same have not yet had their due and entire effect, the executive
shall order the immediate fulfilment of the decree of the general Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gress
of the 9th of February, of the year last past, the provisions of the
supreme executive of the 12th of the same month, and the regulations
of the Sth of December last, relative to the new project and arrangement
of the tobacco income.</p>

<p>Art. 2. Should there be no judges in this capital capable of duly
attesting and classifying the various kinds of tobacco, the value of which
has to be paid to the holders thereof, according to its class, the executive
shall order that of the tobacco, which, on examination thereof for this
sole object in the places where it is found to exist, shall prove to be
profitable and fit for consumption, both crude and manufactured, the
necessary quantity shall be forwarded to the manufactory of Mexico,
that the same may be duly attested and classified, taking measures to
prevent the transportation thereof being attended with unnecessary ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pense.</p>

<p>Art. 3. The executive, after being informed of the classification of
the different kinds of tobacco, shall take care that the value thereof be
punctually paid within such prudential term as he shall compute to be
consistent with the different attentions of that branch of the revenue.</p>

<p>Art. 4. After the publication of this law in the chief towns of the
districts, the sale and consumption of tobacco, crude and manufac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tured,
shall be prohibited; in pursuance thereof the State alone can

<fw type="header" place="top">Laws and Decrees of Coahuila and Texas.</fw>

hereafter expend and provide for the consumption thereof in the towns
of the same, for which purpose a cigar manufactory shall be established
in this capital, as soon as possible, for paper cigars and other kinds, with
such offices as are absolutely necessary. The executive shall propose the
number and class of the same, their salaries, shall frame suitable regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions;
all of which he shall gives notice to Congress for approval.</p>

<p>Art. 5. To put the manufactory in operation, and to give life and
activity to the income, the executive shall contract a loan of the amount
he shall deem necessary, on the most suitable basis and conditions;
making to the contractor such proposals as are just, and capable of being
punctually fulfilled, likewise admitting proposals of the same kind; for
all which he shall have sufficient power.</p>

<p>Art. 6. During the interval, until the regulations specified in art. 4
are approved, he shall be likewise duly authorized to protect the financial
concerns, and faithful management of the manufactory, taking all such
measures as he shall deem seasonable and prudent, to have the purchasers
of paper made at the most reasonable prices; but as this article is very
dear at present, to compensate for the high price thereof, two cigars shall
be deducted from each bunch, and in the places where the cigars are
sold, it shall be expressly prohibited to exact any other tax from any
cause, and on any pretense whatever.</p>

<p>Art. 7. As regards the organization of this rent, proper provision
shall shortly be made in the plan for the provisional regulation of all
the State rents, to be decreed by another law.</p>

<p>For the fulfilment thereof, the governor of the state ad interim shall
cause the same to be published and circulated.</p>

<p>Given in Saltillo on the 19th of February, 1825.</p>

<head>DECREE No. 16.</head>

<p>The constituted Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas, desiring
by every means to augment the settlement of its territory, to advance
the raising and increase of stock, and the progress of the arts and
commerce, in conformity with the constitutive act, the constitution of
the Republic, and the basis established by decree No. 72, of the general
Congress, has thought proper to decree the following,</p>

<head>COLONIZATION LAW:</head>

<p>Article 1. All foreigners who, in virtue of the general law of the

of the State of Coahuila and Texas, are permitted to do so; and
the said State invites and calls them.</p>

<p>Art. 2. Those who shall thus emigrate, far from being molested,
shall be admitted by the local authorities of said settlements, and per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted
by the same freely to engage in any honest pursuit, provided

<fw type="header" place="top">Laws and Decrees of Coahuila and Texas.</fw>

they respect the general laws of the Republic, and the laws of the
State.</p>

<p>Art. 3. Any foreigner, already arrived in the State of Coahuila and
Texas, who shall resolve to establish himself, and become domiciliated
therein, shall make a declaration to that effect before the Ayuntamiento

he shall be sworn to obey the Federal and State Constitution, and to
observe the religion prescribed in the former; and his name, and those
of his family, if he have any, shall be registered in a book to be kept
for the purpose, specifying the place he is from, his age, occupation;
whether he is married, and that he has taken the oath prescribed, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sidering
him henceforth, and not before, as domiciliated.</p>

<p>Art. 4. Any foreigner, from the time he is domiciliated agreeably
to the foregoing article, shall be permitted to specify any vacant land,
and it shall be the duty of the respective political authority to forward
the instrument that shall be drawn to the executive for his approval,
should he consider the applicant the same as the natives of the country,
conforming to the existing laws on the subject.</p>

<p>Art. 5. Foreigners of any nation whatever, and natives of this re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />public,
can project the formation of new towns upon lands entirely va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cant;
and, in the ease of article 35, even upon those privately appro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />priated;
but the new settlers, who present themselves to be admitted,
shall prove, by certificate from the authorities of the place from which
they came, their Christianity and good moral character.</p>

<p>Art. 6. Foreigners, who shall arrive at a time when the general Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gress
shall have prohibited their entrance for the purpose of colonizing,
as after the year 1840, the same will have power to do, or sooner with
respect to those of some nations, shall then not be admitted; and those
who shall apply within the proper time, shall always submit to such
precautionary measures for the safety of the federation, with regard to
themselves, as the supreme executive, without prejudicing the object of
this law, shall adopt.</p>

<p>Art. 7. The executive shall take care that within twenty frontier
leagues bordering on the United States line, and ten littoral leagues
upon the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, within the limits of the State, no
other settlments shall be made than such as shall meet the approbation
of the executive of the Union, to whom all future petitions on the sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject,
accompanied by a corresponding report, shall be transmitted.</p>

<p>Art. 8. Projects for new settlements, wherein one or more persons
shall offer to bring, at their own expense, one hundred families or more,
shall be presented to the executive; who, on finding them in con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formity
to this law, shall admit the same, and immediately designate to
the contractors the land whereon they shall establish themselves, and
the term of six years, within which they shall present the number of
families for which they contracted, under the penalty of losing the
rights and privileges offered in their favor, in proportion to the num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber
of families they shall fail to introduce, and of the contract becom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing

absolutely null, should they not present one hundred families at
the least.</p>

<p>Art. 9. Contracts made by the contractors or empresarios with the
families which come at their expense, shall be guaranteed by this law,
so far as they are in conformity with the provisions thereof.</p>

<p>Art. 10. In the distribution of lands, a preference shall be given
to the military, in consideration of the patents issued them by the
supreme executive entitling them to land, and to Mexican citizens not
military, between whom no other distinction shall be made than such
as is founded in their special merit and services rendered the country,
or in equal circumstances, a residence in the place where the land is
situated. The quantity, whereby the lands are to be distributed, shall
be designated in the following articles:</p>

<p>ART. 11. A square of land measuring one league, consisting of five
thousand varas on each side, or what is the same thing, a superficies
containing twenty-five million varas, shall be called a sitio, and this
shall be the unit for enumerating one, two or more sitios, in the same
manner as one million square varas, or one thousand square varas on each
side, which shall constitute a labor, shall be the unit for counting one,
two or more labores. The vara for this measure shall consist of three
geometrical feet.</p>

<p>Art. 12. Adopting the aforesaid unit as a standard, and observing the
distinction to be made on distributing lands, between grazing lands
or those suitable for stock raising, and irrigable tillage land, and
that which is not irrigable, this law shall grant to the contractor or
contractors for forming new settlements, five sitios of grazing land, and
five labores, of which at least one half shall be land not irrigable, for
every hundred families they shall introduce and establish in the State;
but they shall receive this premium only for eight hundred families,
.although they should introduce more; and no fraction whatever, not
completing one hundred, shall entitle them to a premium, not even pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portionally.</p>

<p>Art. 13. Should any contractor or contractors, on account of the
families they shall have introduced, be entitled, according to the fore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />going
article, to more then eleven square leagues of land, it shall be
granted them, but they shall be obligated to alienate the excess within
twelve years: and should they not, it shall be done by the respective
political authority at public sale, delivering the proceeds to the owners
thereof, after deducting the costs of sale.</p>

<p>Art. 14. One labor shall be granted to each family included in the
contract, whose only occupation is the cultivation of the soil; and should
the same also raise stock, grazing land shall be added to complete a
sitio; and should the raising of stock be the exclusive occupation, the
family shall receive a superficies of twenty-four million square varas, (be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
a sitio lacking one labor.)</p>

<p>Art. 15. Unmarried men shall receive the same quantity on mar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rying,
and foreigners, who marry natives of the country, shall receive

one-fourth more; those who are entirely single, or who do not com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose
a part of any family, contenting themselves rather with the fourth
part of the quantity aforesaid, which shall be computed to them on the
assignment of their land.</p>

<p>Art. 16. Families and single men who, having emigrated separately
and at their own expense, shall wish to annex themselves to any of the
new settlements, can do so at all times, and the same quantity of land
shall be respectively assigned them, as specified in the two foregoing,
articles; but should they do so within the first six years from the estab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lishment
of the settlement, one labor more shall be granted to families;,
and single men, instead of one-fourth, as specified in article 15, shall re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceive
one-third.</p>

<p>Art. 17. It shall belong to the executive to increase the portions
specified in articles 14, 15 and 16 in proportion to the family, industry
and activity of the colonists, according to the separate reports upon the'
subject that shall be rendered by the Ayuntamientos and commission<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers;
always bearing in mind the provision of article 12th, of the decree
of the general Congress on the subject.</p>

<p>ART. 18. Families that shall arrive conformably to the 16th article,,
shall present themselves forthwith to the political authority of the set<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tlement
they shall have selected; who, recognizing on their part the
necessary conditions required by this law’, shall admit the same, put
them in possession of the lands to which they are entitled, and give<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />notice
immediately to the executive, that the same of himself, or through
persons he shall commission for that purpose, may issue them their
titles.</p>

<p>Art. 19. The Indians of all nations bordering on the State, as well
as the wandering tribes within the same, shall be admitted in market
exempt from all duties in their traffic in the effects of the country;
and should any of the same, being attracted in this manner, and by the
mildness and confidence with which they shall otherwise be treated, wish
to establish themselves in any of the settlements, after declaring them<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
in favor of our institutions and religion, they shall be admitted,
and share the same quantity of land as the settlers specified in articles
14 and 15, always preferring native to foreign Indians.</p>

<p>Art. 20. That no vacancies be left between the tracts, which shall
be carefully avoided in the distribution of lands; it shall be laid off in
squares or other forms, although irregular, should the locality so re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quire;
and to prevent litigation and dispute in making the distribution<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />aforesaid,
as well as in the designation of sites, whereon new towns are
to be founded, the adjoining proprietors, should there be any, shall be
previously notified.</p>

<p>Art. 21. Should any appropriated land be taken possession of through
error in concession, on proof thereof an equal quantity of land en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tirely
vacant shall be granted to the person who obtained the same;
and, moreover, he shall be indemnified by the owner of the land afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
agreeably to a just estimate made by competent judges, and ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cording

that shall appear thereon.</p>

for each sitio of grazing land, thirty dollars; for each labor, not.
irrigable, two and a half; and for each that is irrigable, three and a
half; and so on, proportionally, according to the class and quantity of
land distributed to them; but the payment thereof need not be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pleted
under six years from settlement, and in three instalments: the
first in four, the second in five, and the third in six years, under a pen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />aly
of forfeiting the land for a failure in any of the said payments; the
contractors and the military mentioned in article 10, shall be exempt
from this payment; the former, as regards the lands granted them as a
premium, and the latter, for that which they obtain agreeably to their'
patents.</p>

<p>Art. 23. The Ayuntamiento, each in its own limits, shall collect
the aforesaid funds gratis, by a committee appointed from within, or
without, their own body; and shall remit the same, as fast as collected,
to the depositary or treasurer of their funds and means, who shall give
the corresponding receipt, for no other compensation than two and a
half per cent, which is all that shall be allowed him, and who shall
hold the said funds at the disposal of the Executive, giving an account
monthly of the amounts received and remitted, and of any remissness
or fraud he shall observe in their collection. The treasurers and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittees
shall be held responsible with their property for their manage<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
and moreover the individuals of the Ayuntamiento that shall ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />point
them; and, that this responsibility may at all times be effectual,
the said appointments shall be made viva voce, and information thereof
shall be immediately given to the executive.</p>

<p>Art. 24. The government shall sell to Mexicans, and to them only,
the lands they shall wish to purchase, but shall take care that there
shall not be united in the same hands more than eleven leagues, and
subject to the condition, that the purchaser shall cultivate those he shall
acquire by this title within six years from the acquisition, under the
penalty of forfeiting the same. Allowing the aforesaid condition, the
price of each sitio shall be one hundred dollars for grazing land; one
hundred and fifty for tillage land not irrigable, and two hundred and
fifty for irrigable tillage land.</p>

<p>Art. 25. Until the expiration of six years from the publication of
this law, the legislature of the State can not alter the same in the
provisions thereof, relative to the acknowledgement and the price that
shall be paid for the lands, and the quantity and class, whereby the same

shall immediately proceed to take back from them the lands and titles.</p>

<p>Art. 27. The contractors and the military, already mentioned in their
turn, and those who have acquired lands by purchase can alienate the
same at any time, provided the successor obligates himself to cultivate
the same within the same term as was obligatory on the part of the
original proprietor, likewise reckoning the term from the date of the
primitive titles. The other settlers shall be authorized to alienate their
land, when they shall have completed the cultivation thereof, and not
before.</p>

<p>Art. 28. Every new settler, from the time of his settlement, shall
be permitted to dispose of his land, although it shall not be cultivated,
by testament made in conformity to the laws that are now, or shall

heirs, shall succeed him in the enjoyment of his rights and property,

the respective grantee.</p>

<p>Art. 29. The lands acquired by virtue of this law shall not be held

all their property, but after thus leaving, they shall no longer hold their
land; and should they not have previously disposed of the same, or
should not the alienation be in conformity to art. 27, it shall become
entirely vacant.</p>

<p>Art. 31. Foreigners who shall have obtained land according to this
law, and established themselves in the new settlements, shall, from that

of the Republic, they shall possess a special merit for obtaining letters
of citizenship of the State, saving what the constitution of the State,
on either subject, shall provide.</p>

<p>Art. 32. During the first ten years from the time the new settle<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments

<p>Extraordinary poivers of the Governor of the State fro tem.</p>

<p>
The Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas, reflecting that the
persons who excite commotion and disorder under various pretexts
will resort to seduction, deceit, and artifice of every kind, to subvert
the present form of government, commencing by offenses committed
against the highest authorities of the State; also, desiring at the
same time to take proper measures to preserve order, and to save the
State from the evils of anarchy that would result from the dissolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the highest powers, has thought proper to decree as follows:</p>

<p>The Governor of the State pro tem. is invested with extraordinary
administrative powers, and without subjection to legal forms, to arrest
those persons without distinction of rights of law, against whom there
may be in his opinion a strong suspicion that they will attempt to dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turb
the public tranquility, under whatever pretext; and also to des<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tine
the said persons, for a time not exceeding three months, to such
places in the State as he shall think most proper for the preservation of
order; independent of the process he shall order to be instituted against
them according to the existing laws, in the places to which they are
destined; unless they are of the military, in which case, on being appre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hended,
they shall be delivered over to their respective commanders.</p>

measures for the public safety, and that all necessary means should!,
be exercised to restore and strengthen the confidence of the people in
their representatives and others who from duty contribute to the
maintenance of order, has thought proper to decree:</p>

<p>Art. 1. Every public functionary elected by the people, directly or
indirectly, or appointed and approved by the government, who shall
have signed, or in any evident manner supported the turbulent and
subversive pretensions, attacking the State Sovereignty, that have been,
directed to Congress, and exist in the original in the Executive Depart<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
unless it shall appear by some official document that the same
withheld his vote, shall be immediately suspended in the exercise of his
functions.</p>

<p>Art. 2. Every Ecclesiastical judge who shall have signed the same<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />addresses,
shall likewise be suspended in the exercise of his attributes,
notice being previously given to whom it belongs to appoint another to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />act
in his place until the former shall have vindicated himself, agree<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ably
to the laws.</p>

<p>Art. 3. Should any Curate be thus implicated, notice shall be given,
to the respective Ecclesiastical Judge to suspend him in his functions,

to discharge his sacerdotal duties.</p>

the process that shall be instituted, according to law, against all
persons comprised therein.</p>

<p>Art. 6. Others, who shall have signed the aforesaid documents, shall
not hold the Ayuntamental offices, which in virtue of the provision of’
Art. I, it should be necessary to refill; neither shall they exercise a vote<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />in
the elections that offer for that object. This measure shall in nowise
impede the process that shall be instituted against them should they
have deserved it by a more censurable conduct in the affair.</p>

<p>AMNESTY.</p>

<p>The Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas, desirous that the

said Congress witnessing with indescribable pleasure that the imper<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rious
circumstances which compelled them to devise all the means of
justice in compliance with the first and most sacred of laws—and since
obvious motives for the public welfare impel the said Congress to ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ercise
the most liberal clemency, which is the most noble attribute,,
and the most adorning prerogative of Sovereignty, pursuant to all
herein manifested, has thought proper to decree as follows:</p>

<p>Art. 1. The political events which compelled the high authorities of
the State to dictate measures within the sphere of their attributes and
considered to be imperiously demanded for thes preservation of the public
order and tranquility of the State, shall be entirely forgotten;—and in
future, under no pretence, shall the said events ever be imputed to the
authors thereof, in whatever manner implicated therein.</p>

<p>Art. 2. In pursuance thereof, all persons absent from their homes,
destined to any part of the State by the Executive in exercise of the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />traordinary
powers granted him by Decree No. 21, and against whom a
process has been instituted in compliance with the said decree, shall be
immediately set at liberty, and the Executive shall direct that they be
assisted out of the State treasury with an amount, which he shall judge<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sufficient,
according to the distance and their rank, to enable- them to
return to the bosom of their families.</p>

<p>Art. 3. Those persons against whom judicial processes have, or should
have been instituted in compliance with Decree No. 22, and the order
of the 11th of March last, and who are consequently imprisoned or under
arrest; and, being public functionaries, suspended from their stations,
shall also be set at liberty, and the latter restored to the full exercise of
their respective functions.</p>

<p>Art. 4. In future, neither the like pardon nor any other grace shall
be extended to those who shall, directly or indirectly, promote anarchy,
attacking, under any pretence, the high authorities of the State; on the
contrary, they shall be judged and punished with all the rigor and sever<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity
of the laws; as shall be done forthwith -with respect to those who shall
disdain the most ample and liberal amnesty granted by this decree, pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceeding
in their cases in strict conformity with the said laws, and with all
the promptitude and energy required by the tenor thereof, to which the
Governor shall carefully attend.</p>

<p>Art. 5. Pursuant to the provision of the foregoing articles, the decree
No. 42 is hereby repealed; and since the difficult and delicate circum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stances,
which gave rise to the extraordinary powers granted the

6th inst., this legislature offered to sacrifice its opinion in behalf of the
public interest, and support any measure of pacification which the ma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jority
of the legislatures of the several states might adopt. Second,—
Until the present, no certain information on that subject has been re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived.
Third,—There are sufficient data for believing that the plan
of Zavaleta, in the principal part thereof,—the election of the mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bers
of the general government—has been adopted. Fourth,—Said
election is of the greatest importance to avoid being without a na<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tional
government on the first of April next, and to prevent the repe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tition
of disasters which have terminated favorably for the present.
Fifth,—This legislature has made known to the president that it would
not contribute to so great an evil by omitting to hold the aforesaid elec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion.
Sixth,—Such an event would only interrupt the order of the
constitution which the state has maintained until the present, and far
from effecting any good, would occasion incalculable evils. Seventh,

DECREE No. 281.
Taking into contemplation that nearly seven years have passed and some
of the towns of the state have not yet completed the distribution of
lands and waters provided in articles 137, 138, 139 and 140 of the
politico-financial regulations, and noting that said infringements have
proceeded from evil intention rather than ignorance on the part of
some persons, who being interested that said distribution may not be
accomplished, excite difficulties with regard to very clear points, but
which have hitherto had the effect they desired, causing injustice and
injury to those who have a right to become proprietors in said lands
and waters, and to the towns where they exist for joint fruition, the
congress of the state of Coahuila and Texas has thought proper to de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cree:

Art. 1. In towns formerly called
of natives
wherein
the distribution of lands and waters, pertaining to the established farm<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tracts
thereof, should not have been consummated in the manner pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided
by decree No. 37, for the politico-financial administration, and in
those which have not commenced the execution of the law in this respect,
said law shall be strictly fulfilled under charge of the Ayuntamientos, on
their most rigid responsibility, within one month from the publication
of this decree.
Art. 2. The department chiefs, in fifteen days after receiving the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plaints
directed to them from said, cause by persons claiming to be ag<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />grieved,
and wishing to use their exertions, shall decide the same ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministratively
and without appeal; after fifteen days have expired from
making the distribution, complaints that are made shall not be heard.

Art. 3. Springs, that in the opinion of said chiefs, are not suscep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tible
of convenient and useful division and lands that are in the same con- •
dition shall be sold at public auction, and the proceeds thereof shall be
appropriated to the expense occasioned by the distribution of the others.
Art. 4. The families mentioned in article 138 of the aforementioned
regulations,-No. 37, shall be considered with respect to the head thereof,
or what is the same thing when the master of the family belongs to that
class formerly called natives, said family shall thereby have a right in
the distribution conformably to said article 138, the same in respect to
Indian widows with or without children; Indians married or widowers,
with or without children, and Indians even unmarried, provided, that
they can become emancipated by law, and this shall be understood even
should the parents of either be living, and as not affecting the right which
said parents also possess.
Art. 5. To each family classed in the manner specified in the foregoing
article an equal share of the distributable lands and waters shall be
given, and on no other ground whatever shall they be allowed to claim a
right to a greater quantity.
Art. 6. The term specified in article 140 of the aforementioned de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cree
No. 37, shall be reduced to three years in towns wherein the distri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bution

wherein the lands and waters herein mentioned have already been dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tributed,
but the titles not yet given, six years shall be reckoned from the
time said lands and waters were adjudicated.

EXPOSITION,
Submitted by the congress of the state of Coahuila and Texas, to both
houses of the general congress, requesting that the term in the laze
of amnesty under discussion may not be limited, and that it may in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cludepersons
not born in the republic, zvho have acqtiired the rights
of citizenshif.
To the Hon. Congress of the Republic.
The legislature of this state, by the newspapers published in this capi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tal,
has been apprized of the project of an act of oblivion in respect to
political offences, whereby the general congress desires to terminate the
internal dissentions, that have caused so many evils to the country, and
that have arisen solely from factions or parties, which have for a long
time disputed the ascendency, and direction of the respective affairs with
the public administration.
Always with artful designs, disregarding, instead of following the
distastes of reason, they have set themselves above the power of the laws
and authorities, committing their pretentions to the successful issue of
arms, which, while it never gives a legal right, leaves open room for sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sequent
complaint against the party that attained the like illegality ; be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sides,
exciting discord, ill-will, and a disposition to persecution and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />venge
among members of the same family, and citizens living under the
same government, for such are the sad results of civil war. It is now time
to apply the proper means to repair these manifold calamities, to consign
the past deviations to oblivion; it is time, in short, to meditate upon
measures of reconcilation to perpetuate union, peace and tranquillity,
without which blessings, the country cannot advance to the attainment
of that prosperity, and greatness, to which she is eminently destined.
In fact, the project of a law of amnesty, that now occupies the attention
of your honerable body, will accomplish so laudable an object should good
faith be hereafter preserved. But the congress of Coahuila and Texas,
animated by the same feelings as the national representatives, desires it
may be granted in more extensive terms, without specifying any epoch, or
excluding persons not born in the country, as article 7th of the project
provides. This body being the legitimate organ of a very considerable
portion of that class of persons, would be wanting in its duty, and in the
immutable principles of justice, did it not claim the equality, to which it
considers them entitled, manifesting to your honorable body that in this
state there are thousands of persons originally foreigners, but who,
being legally established therein, have acquired property and rights,
guaranteed by the constitution and laws, the same as to the natives
of the country: so that, being as much interested as the latter in the

stability and consolidation of the government, they may have partici<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pated
in our political disturbances, and equity and justice require that
they should be treated with the same equality. Therefore this legisla<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture
formally introduces the following propositions, which it requests
your honorable body will condescend to approve.
1.	The amnesty or pardon, granted for political offences, shall extend
to all periods, at which they have been committed.
II.	Said grace shall include those persons not born in the republic,
who, after having legally acquired the civil rights therein, have partici<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pated

EXPOSITION,
Submitted by the Congress of the State of Coahuila and Texas to the
Congress of the Republic, requesting that the Federal Constitution
may not be reformed, except in the manner therein provided.
To the Hon. Congress of the Republic.
The course of all our former revolutions, and the sad experience they
have left, have not sufficed to restrain the pretensions of the two parties,
which, with deceptive purpose, have long contended for a decided victory.
Plans are formed, pronunciamentos, accompanied by appeal to arms, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stantly
occur, and in all these eruptions the principles of the constitution,
and the rights of the people, are proclaimed. But it appears that they
are invoked, only to be destroyed. Action, unfortunately, has never cor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />responded
to declaration; and from the like alternative, distrust, discord,
and a disposition to persecution and revenge constitute our settled course
of action. Before one pronunciamento is entirely organized, signs of an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />other
appear.
One year has not yet passed since the grito of Cuernavaca, rousing
the religious fears of some, and the private interest of others, who were
dissatisfied with the Convention of Zavaleta, became general through<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
the republic. By that grito the lawful authority of the general
congress was disavowed, and most of the state legislatures dissolved, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />(398)

der the pretext of having issued laws on religious and other reforms, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sidered
contrary to the federal and state constitutions. If this alone
caused a general and simultaneous movement throughout the republic,
what may be expected from the violent reforms, that now occupy the at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tention
of your honorable body?
The manner they are attempted has justly attracted the attention of
this legislature The subject is of great importance, besides, this body,
representing the people, proud of having always sustained the immutabil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity
of the fundamental principles of the constitution, would be wanting
in its most sacred duty, were it to refrain from manifesting to your hon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />orable
body its ardent desires for their preservation, and its determina<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
firmly to sustain them. If at all times, and in all places, reforms
have been dangerous for Coahuila and Texas they would be more so now
than ever. Bordering on a powerful and flourishing republic, and a con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />siderable
portion of its territory already settled with thousands of inhabi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tants,
whom the spirit of change does not suit, and who cannot conform
to such inconstancy in the most essential acts of the public administra<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
the contemplated. reforms would highly compromit, not only the
internal order and tranquillity, but also the very integrity of the national
territory. For effecting these reforms, ideas and opinions have been ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vanced
in your honorable body, as unreasonable as if the present general
congress considered itself possessed of unlimited power to alter the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitution.
It is not conceived how a national representation, owing its
origin to an existing fundamental pact, can have power to re-reform or
change it as it may think proper. Upon what principle of constitutional
right can it be founded? What former acts for its organization could
have conferred upon it so extraordinary a prerogative? The electoral
acts, from which source its authority was received,—were they not per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed
according to the same constitution? Then, the present national
congress neither does or should possess more powers than those intrusted
in articles 47, 48, 49 and 50 of the federal constitution, as the people, in
constituting the same, have exercised no other acts or forms than those
prescribed by the same constitution, and in the manner therein provided.
Therefore, the State of Coahuila and Texas, lawfully represented by its
legislature, protests in the most solemn manner, that having joined in
the confederacy by virtue of the fundamental pact, and and on the basis
therein established, it neither does, or ever will, recognize the acts and
measures emanating from the general congress, should they not conform

other amendments of the constitution than .those effected conformably
to the steps and requisites provided in the same; on the contrary, it will
regard any measure, transcending these legal provisions, as a violation
of its sovereignty. A fatality, ever to be regreted, has inclined
us to endeavor to repair one evil by means of another. When a

and others enacted, whereby such preponderance is given to the privi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />leged
classes that they will not cease to reiterate their disorderly efforts
to continue their abuses. The civic militia is diminished throughout
the republic, or, more properly speaking, the only defence of liberty, and
of the rights of the commonwealth, is destroyed. The national execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive,
whose attention should be given to the revolution in the south, pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pares
a military expedition against the friendly state of Zacatecas, which
has so often contributed to the national renown by curbing despotism
and the abuse of power. The general commandant of the interior states,
intervenes in the most turbulent manner in the internal administration
of the state of Coahuila and Texas, to the extremity of dictating orders
prohibiting the execution of some of the laws issued by this legislature,
and commands the garrisons to move from their stations upon the fron<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tier
where they are so much needed against the savages, and to approach
this capital, evidently with the intention of overawing the civil authori<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties,
and accomplishing his capricious designs. The natonal executive,
to whom application has been made to restrain these encroachments of
the military authority, maintains a profound silence in so delicate a mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter.
Every thing indicates the danger with which we are threatened,
and should we not proceed with great circumspection and wisdom, we
shall be again involved in a civil war, and its consequent evils still more
disastrous than the past. That we are on the verge of that condition,
cannot escape the wisdom and penetration of your honorable body,
which, it is hoped, will not fail to adopt efficient and seasonable meas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ures,
and which, with that view, this legislature has the honor to address.

INTRODUCTORY PROPOSITION,
Directed to the General Congress by the legislature of the State of
Coahuila and Texas, on the subject of repealing^ the laiv diminish<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the national local militia, in support of a similar proposition,
directed by the Congress of Zacatecas.
To the Hon. Congress of the Republic.
The decree diminishing the civic militia, has called the attention of this
legislature, and determined it to propose its repeal. This body would fail
in its duty, were it to be indifferent to the serious evils that the fulfillment
of that decree would cause to the entire nation and to the state it repre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sents.

Coahuila and Texas suffers a cruel and desolating Indian war. The
garisons destined to pursue and chastise the savages, besides being in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />capable
of acting, from absolute neglect, are seperated from the purpose
for which they were established at the pleasure and caprice of the general
commandants, who withdraw them from the frontier when they choose,
as is actually the case in this state, in which the commandant Don Mar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tin
Perfecto de Cos has considered it more proper and beneficial to co<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erce
the supreme authorities, and favor the disturbances of one town, than
to pursue the savages, although they are destroying the lives and prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty
of the citizens.
In so perplexed and difficult a state of affairs, can the congress of
Coahuila and Texas be desired not to remonstrate on seeing the civic
militia disappear, its sole support and defence—the only force that can
apply itself to the preservation of order, and support of the laws ? What
would be its condition in such an event? The most deplorable and ab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject
that could occur.
The cause of the revolutions we have suffered is in vain imputed to
the militia. Recourse has been had to this as a pretext for impugning
the militia, but it is impossible not to know and discern that they have
all been occasioned by the standing army. We should remember that in
Guanaxuato the institutions were saved by the civic militia.
The congress of the state of Zacatecas, in the exposition it directed
to your honorable body, on the 7th instant, completely refutes all the ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tifice
that has been resorted to against the national local militia, clearly
manifesting the propriety of its conduct, the necessity of its existence,
and that it has not caused the evils which the enemies of liberty have
been willing to suppose.
The state of Coahuila and Texas being of the same opinion, and in
the situation above represented, supports the aforementioned exposition
in all its parts, and requests that your honorable body will revoke the
decree diminishing the civic militia in the states.
The well known wisdom of th® national representatives induces the
belief that the remonstrances of this legislature will be dispassionately<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />heard,
and that, in consideration of the public good, the revocation it re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quests
will be enacted.

To the Hon. Congress of the Republic.
This legislature has received the decree of the 25th of April last, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pealing
that issued by this legislature on the 14th of March preceding,
.authorizing the executive of the state to dispose of land, to the amount
•of four hundred sitios, to relieve the exigencies of the state with its pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceeds,
with power to regulate the colonization of said lands on the basis
and conditions he might judge proper, without being subject to the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vision
of the law of the 26th of March, 1834.
The legislature of this state could not but regard with extreme re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gret
the impossibility that offers for fulfilling the decree of the general
congress, repealing that of this legislature of the 14th of March last, for
reasons which it proceeds to explain.
It becomes necessary to show that the decree of the 14th of March,
in its 1st and 2nd articles, is not opposed to the general colonization law
of the 18th of August 1824, because for that contravention to exist, it
were necessary that it should expressly so appear in the aforementioned
decree. Article 1st says—the executive may dispose of the vacant lands
of the state, to the amount of four hundred sitios. There is not an ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticle
in the whole law of the 18th of August 1824, that can bear analogy
to article 1 of the decree in question, unless it be the 12th, who pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hibits
more than 11 sitios to be united in the hands of a single owner;
hence it is obvious that eleven do not resemble four hundred, inasmuch as
this apparent difficulty is explained by the provision of article 2nd, which
says—he shall regulate the colonization of said lands on the basis and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditions
he may think proper, without being subject to the provision of the law
of the 26th of March of the year last past, which does not mean
that he may alienate the four hundred sitios to a single owner,
but, that in regulating the colonization of said lands, he shall not be sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject
to the formalities provided in the law of the state of the 26th of
March 1834,—a law which congress could vary, modify, or alter. But it
is unreasonable to infer from the contents of this article that congress also
intended that the executive should not be subject to the general law of
the 18th of August 1324, in regulating the colonization of said lands. The
most conclusive evidence this legislature can give that it was far from
thinking to attack the general law of the 18th of August, is the decree
which it issued on the 30th of the same month of March, declaring that
the power granted the executive for disposing of the four hundred sitios
of land should be understood as subject to the general laws of the union, of
(411)</p><pb n="412" xml:id="P0412" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/420/" /><p>302
Laws and Decrees of Coahuila and Texas.
which two copies, authenticated in the secretaries office, are accompanied
herewith, since it may have happened that the general congress was not
apprized of said decree during the discussion of that of the 25th of
April.
Thus much in regard to the 1st clause of article 1st of the afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mentioned
decree; so far as respects the second, this legislature is com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pelled
to say, that, by declaring null the transactions performed by virtue'
of the decree of the 14th of March, the public faith stands violated in.
the contracts, since, resulting that in the first and 2nd articles thereof,,
it is not in opposition to the general law of the 18th of August, the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tracts
ratified between the executive of the state, and the parties with
whom they have been concluded, must also be valid and perfect.
This legislature has read and deliberately weighed the literal text of.
article 7th of the general law of the 25th of April last, and does not
find, either i nthe letter or the spirit of the former, the reasons of the lat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter
for prohibiting the border and literal states from alienating their va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cant
lands for colonizing thereon, until the regulations to be observed in
doing it shall be established.
Article 4 is still more impracticable for our case,—for the plain rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son
that the executive of the state has already ratified contracts with
private individuals for colonizing these four hundred sitios of land, and
received sums of money on account, which are applied to no other than
the most urgent expenses of the state; and now, to declare null contracts
made in good faith and on just ground, is to destroy the public faith,
not only of the state, but of the whole nation. It is furthermore an
ex post facto law, contrary to the constitutive act and federal constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion.

Finally, who does not perceive in this document of the 14th March,
that its substance and object is no other than a financial measure, apper<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining
exclusive to the congress of the state, and whose tenor, under
no aspect, is embraced in the prerogatives of the general congress as de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed
in article 50 of the federal constitution?
The present circumstances attending the prompt and exact fulfilment
of the decree of the general congress of the 25th of April, repealing that
of the 14th of March preceding, issued by this legislature, are of such
a nature, the public faith of the state is pledged in such a manner, that
it is not possible to retract an action, that is already performed, be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cause
a right conceded to the general government to that extent, in a
contract already ratified, produces a retroactive effect, and this, as has
already been seen, cannot be done without attacking the federal consti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
which prohibits retroactive laws.
It is furthermore necessary to call the attention of your honorable
body to a point of view, the most important in the subject. On the first
of March last, when this legislature was installed, there was not even a
dollar in the coffers of the state to meet the principal and most indispen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sable
expenses, owing to the large disbursements, the past administration
had to make on account of the turbulent revolt produced by one town of
the state against its supreme authorities, and legislative and executive
acts during the preceding two years term—disbursements which it is
( 412 )</p><pb n="413" xml:id="P0413" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/421/" /><p>Laws and Decrees of Coahuila and Texas.
303
still necessary to make on account of the anarchy that prevails by rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son
of the open protection afforded by the general commandancy. Be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sides,
could a state long exist, whose officers are not paid their salaries,
or at least a part of their dues, should they not be paid with due punctu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ality?
Could it be reasonably expected that the general government
would purchase these lands at a time when its resources were exhausted,
and when all that it could offer to them would have been on account
of the contingent expense corresponding to the state, of which the liqui<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dation
is pending.
The alienation of these lands has been on extraordinary measure of
finance, the object of which was to give vitality to the state when all
the avenues of the ordinary branches that form its public treasury were
obstructed. To destroy this measure at a single blow by provisions, im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />practicable,
compromitting, and so extensive in their effect, is the same
as to annihilate the political existence of the state; to attack the sover<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eignty
stipulated in the federal compact in respect to the internal ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministration
of everything pertaining to it throughout the whole ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tent
of its territory. It is destroying the federal compact.
Eor all these considerations, and others that arise on examining the
subject in all its bearings, this legislature, exercising the prerogative con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
by the constitution, offers to the deliberation of the general con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gress
the following,
INTRODUCTORY PROPOSITION.
