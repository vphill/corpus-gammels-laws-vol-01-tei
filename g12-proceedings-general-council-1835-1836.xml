<p>The President presented to the Council a proposition from Mr. A.

regular army of Texas, which was ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the select committee to whom had been committed
the duty to make extracts from sundry communications from the United
States, and elsewhere, and to report to the army on the prospect before
us, made the following report:</p>

<head>"GENERAL COUNCIL-HALL, San Felipe de Austin,
<lb />November 15, 1835.</head>

<p>The Council met at the special call of the Lieutenant-Governor, who
submitted a number of documents received since the last meeting, from
the United States, and various parts of Texas, principally relating to the
present situation of the country. After the papers and documents were
read, Mr. Barrett moved that Messrs, Martin, - Clements and Millard be
a committee to report upon the state of the army, &amp;c., and that the Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil
adjourn to meet in one hour.</p>

<p>On meeting of the Council the committte made the following report:</p>

<p>“Your committee to whom was referred the present state of our army,
now in the field, and our views of the best course which we advise here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after
to be pursued, respectfully report:</p>

<p>
“That in our opinion the Governor and Council should not appoint
or commission any officers for the command of said army unless pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />viously
elected or recommended by themselves, but that a confidential
correspondence be immediately and directly opened with some of the
most influential and active officers of the present army, now before Bexar,
with the view that their objects and intentions may be distinctly under<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stood,
and that a committee of two gentlemen be appointed to proceed
immediately to headquarters, with instructions from the Governor and
Council, charged with this correspondence, should they find that the
army must inevitably break up, to advise a guarded and orderly retreat

upon the Guadaloupe, but if, in their opinion, they can sustain them<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
in their present condition, until the artillery, ammunition, &amp;c.,.
can be received from the United States and forwarded to that place, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />do
so by all means,—that this Council will do all in their power to sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain
them, and provide for their comfort.”</p>

<p>On motion, it was resolved that William Pettus and Thos. Gay be the
gentlemen to whom this correspondence shall be entrusted, with instruc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
to advise prompt and full communication with the Governor and
Council.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. J. A. Wharton, it was resolved that Messrs. Barrett
and A. Houston be appointed a committee to make such extracts from
reports and documents, received by the General-Council as would give
them all the information now in its possession. The following extracts
contain all the information deemed .necessary to be communicated.
By a letter addressed to the Provisional Government, by the Committee
of Safety, of the jurisdiction of Liberty, dated the 9th inst., is the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />'lowing
extract:</p>

<p>"The committee would respectfully express their hope that all personal
prejudices heretofore existing among us may be laid aside, and an uni<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />versal
feeling of harmony and confidence prevail. In behalf of their
fellow-citizens, they state that a premature Declaration of Independence
would be inexpedient, and injurious; that a temporary provisional organi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zation
of government with a careful attention to the development of
events is the best policy, that a precipitate secession from the Mexican
Republic might incur reprehension.”</p>

<p>By a letter from San Augustine, of the third inst., from the Commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee
of Safety of that jurisdiction, the General Council is informed that
sixty volunteers from the United States will reach that place to-morrow,
destined for. head quarters; that efforts are making to mount all the men
at Nacogdoches which can be obtained, destined for the same place, and
say that upwards of 40 mounted volunteers will march from this place on
the 6 th inst.; that the patriotism of the citizens of Ayish District, Tene<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />haw,
and Bevil’s settlement, is worthy of notice; that the people on Sa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bine
river seem wanting'in patriotism. That in this place thirteen horses
and four hundred dollars, cash, have been subscribed since Sunday last,,
added to former subscriptions destined for the support of their country,
make in the aggregate a considerable amount; much larger sums will
be advanced if necessary; that the whole number of men soon to march
from this place and Nacogdoches will make one hundred and fifty. We
wish to communicate the same, without delay, to the commander-in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chief
of the army of Texas. We enclose you a copy of a letter from
Natchitoches, from D. H. Vail, Esq., that you may see the interest felt
in that place for the citizens of Texas. The letter above referred to,
from D. H. Vail, is dated October 31st, 1835, from which we make the
following extract:</p>

<p>“On yesterday we started a subscription, and about $800, in different
articles, have been subscribed and received.—I have been appointed
treasurer—you must instruct the teams to haul out all I have to send.
The French population, indifferent, have come out ‘and subscribed lib<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erally
to day, and I believe all will, eventually, assist. The company from
New Orleans, left to day at twelve o’clock, I have sent by them $100,
in blankets, clothing, and provisions. The Mexican Consul, at this place,

<pb n="555" xml:id="P0555" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/563/" />

tore down his sign and stamped it under foot, and says he is with the
people. The wagons have just arrived—I shall immediately load them
with arms and baggage, of camp No. 1, Texas Volunteers.”</p>

<p>In a letter from Mr. Ira Ingram, dated Goliad, October 31, 1835, we are
informed of the arrival there of twenty-five men, from Bay Prairie, which
enabled the commandant of that place to send on that day thirty-seven
men for reducing the garrison and fortress on the Nueces, the expedition
on the 30th ultimo. He also states that permanent peace has been made
with the Carancahua Indians—fifty men are kept at that post, generally,
in good health.and spirits.</p>

<p>By letters and enclosures from Thomas F. M’Kinney, and M’Kinney
&amp; Williams; we give you the following—M’Kinney and Williams write
under date of the 9th instant:</p>

<p>“Enclosed you have a copy of a letter from a very confidential friend
of ours, at Tampico, 19th ultimo. We also state that the schooner Louis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />iana
just arrived at New Orleans, from Mobile, where two thousand dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars
has been subscribed for the assistance of Texas.”</p>

<p>This letter gives the idea that the people of the United States are
coming in great numbers to our assistance. The Mexican schooner Monte<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zuma,
with another vessel, is cruizing in the Gulf. The Vera Cruzana
is off Matagorda—more commissions for vessels in the Texas service are
requested. Enclosed in this letter is one from George Fisher, of New
Orleans, of a very confidential nature.</p>

<p>By the Tampico letter it is stated that a proclamation is issued rela<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive
to Texas, which has produced a great excitement there. A battalion
of five hundred men from that town, it is said, have marching orders for
Texas by Col. Gomez, at the request of Cos. We extract the following:</p>

<p>“An express arrived here from Cos, for Gomez, a day or two since,
particulars not known. Texas has many friends in this state, and I am
confident that if she sustains herself for a few months, that the army in
-the interior will have work of more importance than ten of Texas. An
express relative to Texas left here for Mexico two days since, with orders
to reach there in four days. Santa Anna will demand money from the
churches, and report says will be on his march for Texas in a few months,
with about ten thousand men. I should not be surprised to see Santa
Anna here in Tampico, in sixty days, on his way to Matamoras, and
Texas. I hope that no doubts are now entertained in Texas as to his
intentions towards them; Gomez’s proclamation speaks for itself, he
swears that no Anglo-American shall be left in Texas—that he will drive
you as smoke before the wind.”</p>

<p>A letter enclosed from Mr. Fisher, of New Orleans, of the 4th inst.:</p>

<p>“In my last I have informed you of my plan of operations, and now
give you further and more ample advice. We will leave on the 6th inst.
for Tampico, armed and equipped as the circumstances require—every
thing there will be in readiness,—we shall be assisted by the steamboat
and its establishment at the bar,—pilot, &amp;c., now wating for us; thence
we will proceed to Matamoras, where every thing is also provided, for
the Montezuma being in the Brazos Santiago per information six days
ago, must be a prize to us; there are at present in this port (New Orleans,)
seven Mexican vessels, including the Revenue Cutter, Santa Fe, for va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rious
destinations, if we get the Montezuma, as I hope we will, we will
soon form a squadron and stop the revenue of the usurper, which will

prevent his molesting you at sea. I am going in the capacity of secretary
to the expedition. We have some five officers, and about one hundred
and fifty men. Carabajal, Fernando De Leon, and Peter Car have char<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered
a vessel to leave here in a few days for the Gareitas, with provisions .
and merchandise for <hl rend="italics">family use,</hl> as they say.</p>

<p>By a letter addressed to the Provisional Government of Texas, of the
4th inst., from the Acting Committee, &amp;c., of the city of New Orleans.
We give the following extracts:</p>

<p>“The Committee of this city on the affairs of Texas, addressed you a
few lines on the 20th October, through Mr. E. Hall, who accompanied
the volunteers from this city, about one hundred and twenty, in all, sent
to your aid, where we hope their services will be useful; we now have the
pleasure of sending about thirty more, raised in Mobile and put under
control of this committee. The contemplated expedition under General
Mexia, of one hundred and fifty men, 'will sail to-morrow on board the
schooner Mary Jane, all well armed and provided for. Tampico is the
place of destination, which we have no doubt will be in his possession
in a few days. He will communicate with you after his arrival by ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />press.
We rejoice at the news of the first blow being struck,with success,
and we sincerely hope that others equally triumphant will be struck.
We shall continue our aid which you may command without reserve.”</p>

<p>A letter was received from T. F. M’Kinney, from the mouth of
the Brazos, dated 11th inst., 12 o’clock at night, which states in sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stance
that he succeeded in getting off schooner San Felipe, aground in
Matagorday Bay; and will in a few days be ready for cruising off the
shores of Texas. The schooner William Robbins will go with her, that
they will immediately leave for New Orleans to negotiate a loan for one
hundred thousand dollars for present purposes—that if money is wanting
in the mean time, he will accept small drafts, 5 of 6 hundred dollars at
a time, until the loan is effected in the United States, he is fearful to have
larger bills drawn on him at one time, on account of the scarcity of
money in the country. By communications from the United States, he
entertains no doubt of obtaining men and money for Texas.—States that
a vessel is cruising off the coast, which exchanged several shots with the
San Felipe while she lay on the beach, on last Thursday,—thinks that
some shot hit the Mexican—she soon put out to sea. A large gun, 18
pounder, is at Matagorda, there being no balls, has not been forwarded
to the army—thinks that General Mexia’s enterprise will be important<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />he
is securing the steamboat boilers with a view to make here a safe
cruiser near shore.”</p>

<p>The commissioners sent out to the Indians report that considerable
dissatisfaction prevails among the northern Indians regarding their lands
in Texas, but are fully of opinion that no hostile movements will be
made if they can have any security their just rights will be protected;
the convention have already acted upon this subject decisively, and di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rected
the Governor and Council to take measures to satisfy them of our
friendship, and determination that their rights shall be fully respected.</p>

<p>The receivers of the public monies of the Department of Nacogdoches
having considerable amount of funds on hand have promptly surren<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered
them to the Provisional Government, which will in a few days be
in the Treasury. All from that quarter evinces liberality and patriotism.</p>

<pb n="557" xml:id="P0557" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/565/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="9" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>We are satisfied from all reports that if we do justice to the northern In<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dians
they will be out friends.</p>

<p>By a communication received from the Committee of Safety of Nacog<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cloches,
of the 10th inst., from which we make the following extract:</p>

<p>"This committee beg leave to enclose a printed copy of a letter re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceived
this morning from San Augustine, for' the information of the
Council, which printed document states in substance, That six hundred
and one volunteers from Tennessee have arrived at Natchitoches, besides
their other arms, having two'eighteen pounders, and the necessary sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plies,
&amp;c., destined for the Texas service, more daily expected at Nacog<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />doches.’
Various opinions are entertained here by the members of the
Council as to the correctness of this information, but Judge Hood, one
of the committee sent out to the Indians, and who returned last evening
from San Augustine, states that he heard of volunteers from North Ala<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bama,
and Tennessee, being on the way, and that the information was
generally believed there to be correct, and that great anxiety prevailed in
those sections of the United States, particularly, in favor of Texas.”
The preceding gives a clear view of all the intelligence in possession of
the Provisional Government, from the several sources named, all which
is submitted to this honorable body, to be forwarded by the President to
the army, agreeably to the foregoing resolution.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, the above report was adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the committee appointed to superintend the print<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
of the proceedings of the Consultation, in pamphlet form, asked to
have the assistance of Mr. Kellogg in transcribing, which was granted.</p>

<p>It having been made known that Mr. Gay had declined bearing certain
despatches to the army, on motion, George M. Patrick was appointed to
supply his place.</p>

<p>His Excellency the Governor,.through Mr. Wharton, communicated
the following message:</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To his Excellency the President and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council of all Texas:</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN—Called pon to discharge the duties of the supreme
Executive of the free and sovereign state of Texas, I commence the task
not withot mistrust of my abilities, but relying chiefly upon your sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port,
and the indulgence of an intelligent and well disposed people, I
am inspired with confidence and cheered by the hope, that our united
eflorts to promote the public good, will not prove unavailing.</p>

<p>I trust that there is hot one of your body insensible to the many dan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gers
that threaten, surround and overhang our adopted country; that
there is not one who does not feel the importance of the great trust con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fided,
and who is not aware of the heavy responsibilities which necessarily
devolve upon us. In the onset, in the very beginning, ere one error is
committed, or an act performed, I call upon yo to summon to your as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sistance
moral courage; to throw around you the impenetrable shield of
honesty; to march onward in the pathway of duty, and undauntedly to
meet the dangers and obstacles which chance or design may throw in

<pb n="558" xml:id="P0558" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/566/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="10" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

your way. If we cower or sink beneath the task, shame and disgrace,
await us, and ruin irretrievable, to our adopted country. Contemplate
the task before you, the dangers to be encountered, and the obstacles to
be removed or surmounted, and decline the task, or make a beginning
with a fixed determination, faithfully and fearlessly to perform, your
duties.</p>

<p>I thus take the liberty to admonish you, because no common duties
devolve upon you.</p>

<p>You have to call system from chaos: to start the wheels of government,
clogged and impeded as they are by conflicting interests, and by dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cordant
materials. Without funds, without the munitions of war; with
an army in the field contending against a powerful foe. These are the
auspices under which we are forced to make a beginning.</p>

<p>2.	Our country is now involved in war. Our foe is far superior to us
in numbers and resources. Yet when I consider the stern materials of
which our army is composed, the gallant and heroic men that are now in
the field, I regard not the disparity of numbers, but am satisfied that we
could push our conquests even to the walls of Mexico. I earnestly recom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mend
that you adopt the most prompt and energetic measures in behalf
of the army; that you forthwith provide all the necessary munitions of
war, so that the army may not be cramped or impeded by remissness on
the part of the Government. And that you be careful to select agents
of known skill and science to purchase artillery and other munitions.</p>

<p>3.	Another important matter will require your immediate attention.
Our seaports and frontier towns are unprotected, and exposed to the
mercy of the enemy. The policy of having them well fortified must be
obvious to all. I therefore recommend the organization of a Civil and
Topographical Engineer Corps, and the commencement of the work of
fortification and defence without delay.</p>

<p>4.	I recommend the granting of Letters of Marque and Reprisal; by
doing which we cannot only prevent invasion by sea, but we can blockade
all the ports of Mexico, and destroy her commerce, and annoy and harrass
the enemy more in a few months, than by many years’ war, carried on
within our own limits. My own mind is satisfied that the whole of our
maritime operations can be carried on by foreign capital and foreign
enterprise. Already applications for commissions have been made; they
are willing to take the hazard, as such afford them every encouragement.</p>

<p>5.	Provisions have already been made for the organization of a corps
of Rangers, and I conceive it highly important that you should place a
bold, energetic and enterprising commander at their head. This corps
well managed, will prove a safeguard to our hitherto unprotected fron<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tier
inhabitants, and prevent the depredations of those savage hordes
that infest our borders. I conceive this very important at this moment,
as it is known that the Mexican authorities have endeavored to engage
them in a war with us.</p>

<p>6.	Volunteers from foreign countries are daily reaching our shores
and enlisting in our cause. These gallant and chivalrous men are actu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ated

which Texas holds forth to the brave and enterprizing; but in
order that it may be now settled and not hereafter become the cause of
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>7.	Some of our red brethren of the Cherokee, Shawnee and other of
their associate bands, are located on certain lands within our limits, to
which it is generally understood that they have a just and equitable title.
They have lately been interrupted in their title by surveys and locations
within the limits which they claim, which has created among them great
dissatisfaction, I therefore recommend that you second the measures of
the laie Convention in this matter, and never desist until the objects
contemplated by that body be carried into effect.</p>

<p>8.	I recommend the employing of agents for foreign countries-; that
they be clothed with special powers, and that they be sent to different
points, with a view of procuring for Texas all the aid and assistance that
a generous and sympathizing world will bestow.</p>

<p>9.	I would also recommend the establishment of a Tariff, and the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment
of Revenue Officers to collect imposts and tonnage duties;
also a collector for the purpose of collecting all sums due the govern-ment
on lands or other sources.</p>

<p>10.	I would now call your attention to the Post-Office Department,
and would recommend the appointment of a Postmaster General—the
appointment made by the previous Council I highly approve, and trust
under your care that this department will flourish and extend its benefits
to every section of our country. I further recommend an express depart<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
to continue during the war.</p>

<p>11.	No time should be lost in the organization of the militia, nor in
the local civil organization of the different jurisdictions of Texas, in
conformity with the plan of the provisional organization of the govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment.</p>

<p>12.	You will find it necessary to appoint a Treasurer and perhaps other
officers which you may hereafter find requisite.</p>

<p>13.	It will also become your duty to select some place as the seat of.
government, at which to hold your regular sittings during the continn<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance
of the present form of government. In doing this you will throw
aside all local partialities and prejudices, and fix on that point possessing
most advantages, and the best calculated to forward our views by giving
promptness and energy to our united actions. I therefore deem it un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />necessary
to make further suggestions on that subject, and will only
add, that a Council-Hall, together with other offices for the different de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />partments
of government, is indispensable.</p>

<p>14.	I have now, gentlemen, touched upon all the matters of import<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance
that have presented themselves to me,—doubtless many have es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />caped
my observation which you will detect. I will, from time to time,
present such other matters for your consideration as may occur to me.
Again permit me to remind you of the necessity of acting with energy,
boldness, and promptitude,—that the welfare of thousands depends upon
your actions. Your country possesses immense resources if properly de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veloped;
it is for you to quicken and enliven the energies of the body
politic, and make Texas the Eden of America.</p>

<p>I conclude, gentlemen, by expressing the hope that the Supreme ruler
of Nations will smile upon your councils, and that, by our united efforts,

<p>“That the immediate appointment of a Treasurer to the Provisional
Government, whose duty shall be clearly defined, is now devolving upon

this body. Receipts and disbursements of the public monies have been
hitherto carried on without system, consequently without any other re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sponsibilities
to the public than that high sense of moral feeling which
so eminently distinguishes the free sons of that country in revolutionary
times from which our citizens have descended.</p>

<p>The dispatch of business in times like the present is very important.
Great injuries are often consequent upon dilatory proceedings in matters
of public concernment; but while promptness is so important, order and
correctness should also prevail. The people should at all times have the
ready means of knowing the acts of their public agents; this can only
be done by adopting general rules, system and consistency of conduct,
in the observance of those rules, and recorded memorials of all our doings.
To this end your committee advise the creation of the office of Secretary
to the Executive, who shall also be the clerk of enrollment of the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings
of the General Council. They also advise the appointment of
two clerks to the several standing committees, whose duties shall be
designated.</p>

<p>Your committee is concerned to see the want of unanimity in this body,
upon a proper location of a place where to establish the sittings and
offices bf the “Provisional Government.” Several places have been men<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned
as suited to this object, and your committee being unprepared
to determine the matter, will briefly submit the representations made to
, them by different persons.</p>

<p>By some it is contended that the location should be in Washington
on the Brazos; this place is said to be situated in a thickly populated
country, and most central to the inhabited parts of Texas. It is known
that this town is of very recent origin, having few if any suitable build<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings
or rooms for public business, and no printing establishment. Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />venience
and retirement are necessary for public officers, in the dispatch
of business of the character in which we are now engaged. These ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jects
cannot be expected at present in Washington, hereafter this place
will no doubt be fixed upon as the seat of Government.</p>

<p>The inconveniencies and discomforts of our present location are too
sensibly felt by every member of the Provisional Government to require
any remarks; an excellent and well conducted Press is the only present
inducement for continuing in San Felipe:—Matagorda and Velasco, des<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />titute
of the latter advantage, possesses no superiority of convenience for
business over San Felipe, and although strongly recommended by some,
will scarcely produce any difference of opinion in this body.</p>

<p>Brazoria, with the advantages of a good and well conducted Press, is
represented as having a suitable Council-Hall, well adapted rooms, and
other conveniences for the dispatch of public business. Its location upon
the navigable waters of the Brazos, affords almost hourly communication
with the coast, and the distance from the army will make but about one
day’s difference in travel more than to San Felipe, and about the same
as to Washington; but the badness of the roads at this season of the
year, is said to be a serious disadvantage, if not an insuperable objec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion.</p>

<p>With these statements your committee submits to the' wisdom of the
Council to determine the place of its sittings, and the location of the
Provisional Government.</p>

will be reported to the Council as soon as time will permit.</p>

<p>“Your committee on Naval Affairs, to whom was referred so much of

and reprisal, have had the same under consideration and respectfully
report,</p>

<p>“Your committee are of opinion that the same should be granted un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der
the following principles and restrictions:</p>

<p>“1st. All persons applying for letters of marque and reprisal should
be men of known character, standing, and skill as naval tacticians, and
no license to cruise as such should be granted to any vessel under eighty
tons burthen, or carry less than four twelve pound carronades, or their
equivalent in metal.</p>

<p>“2nd. All vessels so licensed should cruize in the Gulf of Mexico, and
in no other waters, and should be permitted to war upon, capture or
make prize of all vessels sailing under the flag and under commission of
the Central Government of Mexico, and on no other.</p>

<p>“3rd. All prizes so captured should be ordered or brought into the
ports of Texas, and when there, adjudicated and condemned as prizes to
the captors, by the competent tribunals; there should be retained out of
the monies arising from the sale of said prize or prizes, twenty-five per
cent for the use or Texas, and be paid forthwith into the public Treasury
accordingly, and the balance to be paid over to the. captors, or their as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />signs,
or legal representatives.</p>

<p>“4th. All persons to whom a license to cruise in the Gulf of Mexico,

be given shall give good and sufficient security in a bond, in the sum of
----------- thousand dollars, to be approved by the Governor and Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil,

payable to him and his successors in office, for the faithful adher<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence

<p>5th. That commissions or licenses be not granted for a longer time
than six months, nor less than three, and in all cases to expire at the
conclusion of our war between Texas and the Central Government of
Mexico.</p>

<p>“Your committee would further most earnestly represent that the es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablishment
of a small Naval force for the security of our extended

the purchase, arming, and equipping two schooners of twelve, and
two schooners of six guns each, to cruise in, and about the bays and har<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bors

<p>“Your committee on Finance to whom was referred the accounts of

<p>“That the accounts so submitted against the Government of Texas
are, in their present form unreasonable and ought not to be paid.</p>

<p>The account marked "1," that of Thomas Bray for furnishing Cole’s
company of waggoners, with one hundred and seven pounds of bread,
at twenty-five cents per pound, amounting to twenty-six dollars and sev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />enty-five
cents, should be reduced to fourteen cents per pound; and he
be allowed fifteen dollars and seventy-eight cents, in full for the amount
of his account. And further, the account of Madison M. Stevens, for
carrying one express to Nacogdoches,—that he be allowed compensation
for 10 days service, at two dollars and fifty cents per day, amounting to
twenty-five dollars, and that the amount of his expenses already paid be
deducted from the same, leaving a balance due him of ten dollars and
fifty cents.</p>

<p>NINE O’CLOCK, A. M.</p>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The journals of yesterday’s proceedings having been read,</p>

<p>Mr. Wharton presented the following:</p>

<p>“Resolved, that all ordinances or decrees which may come before the
General-Council, either as reported by committees or any member there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />of,

no ordinance, decree, or resolution shall be finally passed until after a
third reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Perry moved to lay it on the table until the first day of March
next, which was rejected.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, it was ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Parker, the house took up the ordinance, making
provisions for the army now in the field.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris moved to amend it my adding to the list of articles .to be
purchased “25 camp kettles,” which was agreed to.</p>

<p>r. Parker moved to amend by adding twenty axes, which was agreed

<p>Mr. Harris moved to amend further by adding “two dozen shovels,

<p>Whereupon, on motion of Mr. Parker, the ordinance as amended was
passed.</p>

<p>Mr. Wharton, from the committee on Military Affairs, presented the
following report:</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred that part of the Governor’s
Message which relates to the “organization of the Civil and Topograph<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ical
Engineer Corps, and the commencement of fortification and defence
without delay;” have had the same under consideration, and beg leave
to report.</p>

<p>Your committee, deeply impressed with the great importance of an
established system and continued plan of national defence, and the many
advantages resulting, not only from a successful protection of our, here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after
it is to be hoped, extensive commerce; but the peace and security of

<pb ed="unknown" n="22" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

our maritime borders, approach this part of the message, with manifest
feelings of satisfaction and delight, and announce their entire accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance
in opinion with his Excellency on this subject.</p>

<p>In submitting the result of their labours to this body, in search after
the requisite materials out of which to form the corps above described,
your committee have to confess that our country at this moment, what-.
ever it may possess of enterprise and skill, talent and industry, in other
branches of science, adapted to the more immediate necessities of a
pioneer population, is nevertheless, almost entirely destitute of that
species of knowledge essential to the construction of fortifications and
works of defence, in Bays or Harbors, known technically as the art of
engineering. This subject requires the study of a whole life, and a
thorough acquaintance with its principles and practice, is only acquired
by an application severe, painful and unremitting. How can it be ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pected,
therefore, that a corps of so high a grade of merit, talent, and
skill, should be found to exist in embryo as it were, among a population
so recently concentrated from various parts of the world, in this land of
our adoption. We may probably possess within ourselves the materials
necessary, but except in a very few instances they have not shown them<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
to the consideration of a deserving and intelligent people.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore, in default thereof, recommend that we
direct our search to the United States, and procure from thence as many
gentlemen of acknowledged scientific attainments in this arm of defence
as may be necessary. And that this important duty be confided to our
three agents, Messrs. Austin, Archer and Wharton, who are soon to pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceed
on their mission.</p>

<p>Your committee with a view to the furtherance of the object of the
above report, herewith present to this body a bill, which in its enactments
will embrace all the objects contemplated in that part of the Governor’s
Message.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, the foregoing report was received.</p>

<p>Mr. C. B. Stewart, the Secretary elect to the Executive, and enrolling
Clerk of the Council, appeared and took the oath prescribed by the or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganic
law.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Perry, it was</p>

<p>“Resolved, that a standing committee of two be appointed by the
President to be termed the committee on enrollment; which was adopted.
Mr. Parker, introduced an ordinance and decree authorizing certain
officers to administer the oath of office prescribed by the organic law,
creating a provisional government in Texas;” which was read and or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered
to lie on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard, introduced, an ordinance entitled an ordinance and decree

<p>The fifth section having been read, Mr. Clements moved to strike out

agreed to.</p>

<p>After some conversation among the members, Mr. Hanks moved a

the words “six months” again inserted, when the entire report, as amend<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed,
was adopted.</p>

<p>A letter from the Committee of Vigilance and Safety of Nacogdoches

<p>I have the satisfaction to inform you, that since my last, some im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portant
advantages have been gained over the enemy. Capt. Travis has
taken three hundred head of horses that were sent out of Bexar to
Loredo. They are poor horses and were taken out of Bexar about forty
miles.</p>

<p>The enemy is closely shut up in Bexar, and more and more discouraged
every day. All we need is perseverance and reinforcements, to keep up
the army. I entreat the Convention to hurry on reinforcements to keep
up the army, with all possible dispatch, and the campaign will soon end.
There is very little prospect that the enemy will get any aid from the
interior.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>S. F. AUSTIN.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the President, a committee of three consisting of
Messrs. Barrett, Parker and Hanks, were appointed to draft an address to

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the committee, reported the following address.</p>

<head>Council Hall, San FELIPE de Austin,
<lb />November 19, 1835.</head>

<p>FELLOW-CITIZENS of Texas:</p>

<p>The foregoing letter has just been received and read before the General
Council, left in charge of the Provisional Government.</p>

<p>It speaks a language too cheering in prospect of success against our
enemies not to arouse the most ardent patriotism in the bosom of every
friend of liberty, and especially in the hearts of our fellow-citizens of
Texas. By a resolution unanimously adopted in your Council, we are
prompted to call upon our fellow-citizens to rally around the standard
of their country, and unite in accomplishing the glorious object contem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plated
in the letter from the Commanding General before Bexar, and rid
Texas of the last vestige of her enemies.</p>

<p>The incitements to this, must be felt in every mind. Freedom and
the establishment of our rights are the objects, and glory is the certain
consequence of success. We assure you, fellow-citizens, that your army
now in the field has the warmest feelings, and most unalterable deter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mination
of your Representatives to give it aid, comfort and support.
Come then! Liberty and your'country call. The gratitude of your coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try
will speedily be manifested through the representatives now assem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bled,
in substantial bounties and liberal rewards, such as brave and pa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />triotic
men may ever hope from an intelligent and grateful people. It
may be satisfactory to volunteers, who engage in this glorious enterprize,
to know that all the supplies of provisions and clothing, suited to the
necessities of this inclement season, have been procured, and are procur- <pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
through the people’s agents, appointed for that purpose, and that
all their demands will be promptly answered. Let no discouraging re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ports,
or vague and undefined rumors prevent your hasty co-operation
with your brethren in the field: be assured that your representatives will
not deceive you, nor mis-direct your efforts. God and Liberty is the
watchword, peace and tranquillity your reward.</p>

on motion of Mr. Parmer, the ordinance, as amended, was passed.</p>

<p>The accounts of Wm. Stawder were presented, and referred to the
Committee on Finance.</p>

<p>The Executive’s Secretary presented the following message from his
Excellency, the Governor.</p>

<head>Executive Department of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the honorable the President, and
<lb />members of the Legislative Council:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen—The second ordinance, passed by your body, is now be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
me, and has received my serious consideration, so much of it as
goes to the establishing of the salaries of the different officers therein
named, I feel bound to object to. Inasmuch as the chosen delegates of
all Texas, in Convention assembled, determined to preserve strictly the
rules of economy, by rigidly expunging the names of offices well known
to be absolutely necessary for proper organization, it would now be
deemed in us, with whom the power has been deposited, a great error,,
or stretch of that power, if we should create offices, with what the peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple
should consider high salaries. I have every wish that the labourer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />should
be well paid for his services, but inasmuch as we have not a rich
Treasury, and our country involved in war, I think much should be per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed
through motives of patriotism. It must be evident to all, that
the Convention when voting the salaries of the Governor and Lieut.
Governor, were actuated from such motives, well knowing their offices
were the most arduous and responsible within their gift. And as such,
I consider all permanent officers should be graduated from them, and
allowed per annum salaries.</p>

<p>It is quite uncommon that the highest officers should receive the
lowest salaries. I therefore object to that part of the bill.</p>

<p>To the 6th and last decree in the bill, I object, for the following
reasons: There is no printing press at Washington, which I deem es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sential

<pb n="576" xml:id="P0576" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/584/" />

to our business; the public printing has not been yet completed
or contracted for, which should be superintended by your body, nor has
there been any Legislative action known to me, prescribing or defining
the duties of our agents to be sent abroad; their commissions with au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thority
to hypothecate the public lands and pledge the faith of the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try,
to answer our present emergencies, have not been made out. Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missions
granting letters of Marque and Reprisal, have been earnestly
solicited, both by our own citizens and foreigners, and as yet, have not
been acted on. These are things I deem of the most urgent and vital
importance, and should receive prompt attention.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am not apprized that your body has made the neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary
arrangements for our comfortable location at Washington. It ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pears
to me probable that more might be lost than gained by the move;
be that as it may, the move as contemplated and incorporated in the 6th
decree I deem premature, and calculated to produce delay and great in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jury;
as such, I feel bound to object to it. I would beg leave to suggest
to your honorable body that, notwithstanding our situations here may be
uncomfortable, and none can be more so than my own, still a sense of
public duty urges me to earnestly solicit your body to submit themselves
to all inconveniences for the present, until the grand and important busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness
of necessity can be accomplished, and they will find me willing to
co-operate with them in the selection of any point which they may deem
best calculated to promote our own convenience, and advance the public
good.</p>

<p>With sentiments of the highest regard and consideration, I remain,</p>

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH,
<lb />Governor.</p>

<p>San Felipe, 20th November, 1835.</p>

<p>On motion of the Council adjourned till nine o’clock to-morrow morn<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing.</p>

<head>Council Hall, San Felipe de Austin,
<lb />November 21st, 1835.

</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceedings having been read,</p>

<p>Mr. Harris moved that the names of members moving adjournments
of the Council be expunged from the minutes, which was negatived.</p>

<p>The President appointed Messrs. Millard and Grimes the Committee
on Enrollments.</p>

<p>Mr. Wharton, from the Committee on Military Affairs, presented the
following report, accompanied by an ordinance and decree to establish
and organize a corps of Rangers.</p>

<p>“Your committee, to whom was referred that part of the message in
relation to the corps of Rangers, have had the same under consideration,
and beg leave to report,—</p>

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>“That in the opinion of your committee this corps ought immediately
to be organized and put into active service, and with the view of rendering
its usefulness and members more conformable to the number of men in
each company of the regular army, your committee recommend that the
whole number of rangers be one hundred and sixty-eight, and conse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quently
these divided into three companies of fifty-six men each, to be
commanded by one Captain, and one 1st Lieutenant, and one 2nd Lieu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tenant
for each company; the whole number constituting a Battalion,
under the command of a Major.</p>

<p>“Your committee would further recommend the immediate appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
by the Council of all the officers of this corps, and that they report
to the commander-in-chief as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“Your committee present an ordinance to your honorable body for
adoption, which, in its enactments, embraces all the objects contem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plated
by the decree of the Convention.”</p>

<p>Which was read a first time and ordered to a second reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Wharton, from the Committee on Military Affairs, presented the
following report, accompanied by a bill of articles for the army of Texas:.</p>

<p>“The committee to whom was referred that part of the Governor’s<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />message
on the subject of providing the necessary munitions of war,
make the following report:</p>

<p>“That they recommend to the Council the propriety of appointing
Branch T. Archer, -------- -------- special agents to purchase
the annexed bill of munitions of war; that they be instructed to employ
agents of known skill and science to make the purchases—that they pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cure
as many of the articles as .practicable in New Orleans, and forward
them without delay; and that they purchase the remainder so soon as they
arrive at the place where they can’be procured.”</p>

<p>JOHN A. WHARTON, Chairman.</p>

<p>The ordinance accompanying the above, was read a first time, and or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered
to a second reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Wharton, from the Committee on Military Affairs, presented the
following report, accompanied by an ordinance and decree to raise a reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ular
army.</p>

<p>“Your committee to whom was referred that part of the Governor’s
message relating to the army and its complete organization, and sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ply
with provisions and munitions of war, have had the same under con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration
and beg leave to report,—</p>

<p>“Your committee, in viewing the numerical force of the army to be
organized and established by the organic law of the Convention, and the
different corps therein contemplated, have formed the following estimate
of that essential arm of our defence, whose amount and numbers have
been limited by that decree. The Convention has fixed the regular force
of Texas, besides permanent volunteers, and rangers, at 1120, rank and
file; and under these data your committee have proceeded to designate
what species of corps shall constitute the regular army, properly so
called.</p>

<p>“If the belligerent state of Texas did not warrant, and the Convention
had not decreed, that a part of the active force should consist of Perma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nent
Volunteers from the United States, and elsewhere, your committee
would not have been at a loss for a moment to determine and classify the

<pb n="578" xml:id="P0578" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/586/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="30" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

regular army of Texas; but, inasmuch as we shall receive a large body of
volunteers from the United States, who must place themselves in the list
of that class, and the great majority of whom will be riflemen.</p>

<p>“Your committee have deemed it more conducive to the perfect or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganization
of the army, to constitute one entire regiment of Artillery, and
one entire regiment of Infantry. This classification is predicated upon
the fact that the immediate defence of the sea coast, agreeably to the reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution
and decree of the Convention, will require five companies of artil<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lery
at the different points therein indicated, and that there will be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired
for offensive operations in the ensuing campaign, against San An<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tonio
de Bexar, one battalion, or five companies more.</p>

<p>“Your committee would therefore recommend the following organiza<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the regular army, viz:</p>

<p>One regiment of Artillery, 560 men.</p>

<p>One regiment of Infantry, 560 men.</p>

<p>Total number, rank and file, as per decree, 1120</p>

<p>In this organization it follows that each regiment will consist of two
battalions, each battalion of five companies, and each company of fifty<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />six
men rank and file.</p>

<p>"The committe would suggest that as in all well regulated Military
establishments, in every country, the officers of the Engineers and Ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tillery
are selected from their superior science and education, and the
duties of an artillery officer must necessarily be acquired by an acquisi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of at least the rudiments of the more exalted science of engineering,
and as they are frequently called to exercise their talents in both capaci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties,
(as was formerly the case in the United States of America, before
the establishment of an Engineer Corps,) one additional Lieutenant-
Colonel, and one additional Major be added, and one additional Lieuten<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />•ant
to each company in the corps of artillery as indispensable to the
double service contemplated. The regiment of artillery will de officered
as follows:</p>

<p>One Colonel, two Lieutenant-Colonels, two Majors, ten Captains, ten
First Lieutenants, ten Second Lieutenants, and ten Third Lieutenants.</p>

<p>The regiment of infantry will be officered, as follows: One Colonel,
one Lieutenant-Colonel, one Major, ten Captains, ten First Lieutenants,
and ten Second Lieutenants.</p>

<p>The decree of the Convention, adopting the discipline and tactics and
the rules and regulations of the army of the United States of the North,
as the governing principle of the Military code and discipline of the
army of Texas, places this subject of the labor of your committee at rest,
both as to its certainty and precision, and superior advantages of that
code.</p>

<p>“Your committee do not entertain a doubt of its entire applicability
to the circumstances, spirit and organization of our regular force, as
well as permanent volunteers and militia when in the field.
Your committee therefore recommend the passage of the accompany<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
ordinance, and would respectfully urge upon the General Council, to
appoint at least one half of the officers immediately, from the Captains
down, in order that when reported for duty, to the Commander in Chief,

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

they may be ordered on the recruiting service: a measure which they
deem essentially necessary to filling up the ranks of the regular army.</p>

<p>The ordinance accompanying the above, was read first time and or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered
to a second reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard, from the committee on enrollments, reported as duly
enrolled, "An ordinance regulating offices under the Provisional Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the select committee appointed to prepare instruc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
for the agents elected by the Convention, to represent Texas in
the United States of the North, presented the following report, accom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />panied
by an ordinance to authorize and empower Thomas F. McKinney,
of Velasco, to borrow one hundred thousand dollars, and making it the
duty of the Governor to give him corresponding commission, instruc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Your committee beg leave to report, that upon considering the matter,
they are unable to find any acts of the Convention, or of this Council,
whereon to base instructions for the conduct of said agents, or any “data”
which can guide your committee in an opinion of their duties, but from
all the information they can obtain, your committee have concluded,
that the agents should receive their instructions from the Executive; but
in order to enable the Governor to give the necessary instructions, an
ordinance should first be originated by the Committee of State, and
passed and approved, defining in general, the powers and duties of the
agents, and make it the duty of the Executive to give such instructions
as will be conformable to the resolutions of the Convention and the ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nances
of the General Council, made with reference to the subject in
view, when this office was created. But your committee cannot advise
that the Committee of State be instructed upon this subject with pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />priety,
until the reports of the several committees on the Military, Navy
and Finance, have been received and passed, &amp;c., and advise that this
Council instruct these committees severally, to make their general re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ports
upon the matters referred to them, when the Committee of State
will be prepared to report an ordinance as suggested for the considera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of this Council.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore ask to be discharged from the further con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration
of the matter submitted, but take the liberty to report the
following ordinance, which they are induced to do from the emergency
and great press of business.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett the above report was received.</p>

<p>The ordinance accompanying the above, having been read the first
time, on motion of Mr. Parker, the rule of the House requiring ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nances,
&amp;c., to be read on three successive days was suspended, and the
ordinance read a second time.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Parker, the rule was further suspended, and the

<p>Mr. Wharton, from the Committee on Military Affairs, presented the
following report:</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred that part of the Governor’s
Message, respecting the organization of the militia, have had the same
under consideration, and beg leave to report as follows:</p>

<p>Your committee having investigated the ordinance or decree of the
Convention, respecting the organization of the militia, would respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
suggest, that in order to amend the decree so as to have effect, it
would be necessary that the Council should recommend three persons
in their several jurisdictions, whose duty it should be to carry the proc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lamation
of his Excellency into effect, and to divide the several jurisdic<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions,
into militia districts, to advertise and execute the mandate of the
Executive, in order that there be neither neglect or default.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, the above report was received and referred
back to the committee that reported it, with instructions to report again
in form of an ordinance.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the House took up the ordinance for ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointing
a Treasurer to the Provisional Government of Texas, a Secre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tary
to the Executive, and two Chief Clerks, defining their several duties,
&amp;c., returned by the Governor, the objections of the Governor having
been read.</p>

<p>The question was taken, shall this ordinance now pass, the veto of the
Governor to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The ayes and noes being called, every member voted , in the negative.
Mr. Parker moved that the 6th section be adopted. The ayes and
noes were called for, which stood thus:</p>

<p>Ayes—Messrs. Barrett, Grimes, Parker and Parmer—4.</p>

<p>Noes—Messrs. Clements, Johnson, Millard, Harris, Hanks, Wilson,
West and Padilla—8. So the motion was lost.</p>

<p>The President appointed Mr. Johnson on the Committee on Land and
Indian Affairs.</p>

<p>Account marked No. 7, was presented to the Council, and on motion
of Mr. Barrett, the account was allowed, and an order granted on the
Treasury.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard from the Committee on Finance, presented the following
report:</p>

<p>Your Committee of Finance to whom was referred the accounts
marked 4 and 5, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave
to report that they are satisfied with the correctness of said orders, and
would move the adoption.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett moved that the account marked 5 be acknowledged and
paid, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, Mr. Clements was requested to make out a
form for contractors on receipting for services rendered.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the ordinance for appointing a Treasurer,
&amp;c., was referred back to the Committee on State Affairs and Judiciary.</p>

<p>The Council met on the special order of the President.</p>

<p>The President submitted a letter from Capt. E. Hall, suggested the
propriety of granting a commission with letters of Marque and Reprisal
to Mr. A. C. Allen, which was read.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Harris, the ordinance for granting letters of Marque
and Reprisal, and for establishing a Navy, was taken up and read the
second time.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris, moved to amend the ordinance by inserting between the
words “Texas” and “that” the following, “that the Governor, by and
with the advice and consent of the Council, shall have power to grant
letters of Marque and Reprisal;” which was agreed to.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, the rule in this case was suspended and the
ordinance was read the third time, when the question was taken on its
final passage and decided in the affirmative.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Palmer, the House took a recess of two hours.</p>

<p>At the expiration of that time the Council re-assembled.</p>

<p>The President submitted to the Council several communications from

<p>On motion of Mr. Harris, the resolution of the Committee of Safety
of San Augustine, dated October 29th, 1835, was referred to the Commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee

Excellency the Governor:</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN—I have under review three bills which have been passed
by your body, and forwarded to this department. I have duly consid<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ered
the same, and herewith transmit them, with such remarks as ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peared
to me consistent.</p>

<p>The bill authorizing Thomas F. M’Kinney to proceed to borrow, for
the use of the Provisional Government, the sum therein named. I have
only to suggest to your body the impropriety of employing agents with
powers which may conflict with the duties and powers of our general
agents, elected by the Convention, with a view to be immediately dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />patched,
with full and ample powers to perform all the duties incorpo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rated
in said bill, who will also be authorized and instructed by your
body to perform all such other duties as the nature of their mission and
the exigencies of the country may require.</p>

<p>I would only suggest to your honorable body the propriety of making
out instructions, with the proper commissions to those agents thus elect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed,
in order that they be immediately dispatched to perform the duties
assigned to them. And that a committee of fit and suitable persons be
appointed to take this matter under their consideration. And in the
event that those agents specially appointed by the Convention do not
present themselves, that you immediately proceed to appoint others who
will serve; this is a matter which I consider of the most vital importance,
and deserves your prompt attention.</p>

<p>The ordinance next under my consideration, is the ordinance and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cree
regulating offices under the Provisional Government which I ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prove
and have signed.</p>

<p>The next in order is the ordinance establishing a Navy, and granting
letters of marque and reprisal. To this bill I am bound to object as it
now stands. The privileges granted to privateers seems to me rather
unbounded.—That this Government takes all the responsibilities with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
any interest in the captures which may be made.</p>

<pb n="586" xml:id="P0586" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/594/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="38" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>If prizes are brought into our ports, the Government will be at the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pense
of adjudication and sale, without remuneration, provided they
should be found lawful prizes, if not lawful prizes they will be bound to
make remuneration for the act of their commissioned agents, who have
brought into our ports prizes which cannot be condemned and sold as
such. Besides, I consider, agreeably to the provisions of the- ordinance,
that privateers would have an unbridled licence to roam at large, with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
being particularly under the control of the Government, and kept
within limits calculated to protect our own commerce, and might, in the
end, be productive of more injury than good. And, notwithstanding I
have recommended and urged the granting of letters of marque and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prisal,
if they are not commissioned in a manner calculated to promote
the public good by annoying our enemies and protecting our own com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />merce,
they might prove injurious to the Government rather than an
advantage. As such I would like, if commissions are issued, that they
would not derogate from similar privileges granted by other govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments.</p>

<p>As it respects that part of the bill making provisions for the creation
of a Navy. If it should be made out in a separate bill for that purpose,
it would appear much better, and would entirely meet my views, as I
deem it entirely necessary for the protection of our commerce. It is
highly probable that those persons wishing to fit out privateers would
tender their vessels and services to the Government, by having the proper
guarantees, and submit themselves entirely to the control and super<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vision
of the Government. This, if it could be effected, would be much
better than granting an unbridled, roaming license to privateers, which
would neither be productive of security or profit to the Government. I
would therefore suggest the propriety of separating the substantive mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter
of the bill, and introduce one solely for the purposes of creating a
Navy on proper principles, and leaving out the provision for granting
letters of marque and reprisal, unless your honorable body may think
proper to introduce it in a different shape, I am well aware that no good
could result from granting commissions as contemplated by that portion
of the bill and as such object to it.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity further to remind your body of the propriety
of making, without delay, the necessary enactments calculated to au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thorize
the commander-in-chief of the forces of Texas to issue his proc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lamation,
in order that volunteers, and other troops, daily arriving on
our shores, and from various parts of the country, may know to whom
they shall report, and to whom they shall hold themselves amenable,
either as volunteers for a specific time, or as recruits to the regular army,
I deem it entirely uncalled for, and even imprudent, to furnish troops
with clothing or other outfit, without a guarantee to know to whom they
will submit themselves, or what the term of their service shall be.</p>

<p>With these hasty remarks I forward the bills enumerated, hoping your
honorable body will make such disposition of my remarks as their better
judgment may direct.</p>

<p>With sentiments of regard and consideration, I am</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH,
<lb />Governor.

<p>With sentiments &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH,
<lb />Governor.</p>

<head>November, 27th 1835.</head>

<p>The foregoing having been read,</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the Council went into secret session, and
after some time spent therein, the doors were opened.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard, from the Committee on Finance, presented the following
report,—</p>

<p>Your Committee, to whom was referred that part of the Governor’s
message recommending the establishment of a Tariff, and the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of Revenue Officers, &amp;c., beg leave to report,—</p>

<p>In surveying the vast resources possessed by Texas, whether consid<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ered
in a national point of view, or merely with reference to raising a
revenue and establishing a system of permanent income, available at
all times, and considered as the positive wealth of the State. The sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject
presents a more extensive field for the consideration of the politician
and economist than at first anticipated.</p>

<p>In a government such as Texas presents to the world, when the vessel
of state has only just been launched into her proper element, possess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
all the strength and symmetry, all the fine proportions and superior
workmanship of a well constructed ship, it would be a source of great
regret if the operations and objects for which it was created should be
crippled or entirely lost, when the facilities afforded by such extensive
resources were controllable and so completely within our reach.</p>

<p>That money is the sinew of war, is an adage to the truth of which
the most ignorant and unpretending in politcal economy must subscribe,
and which in our peculiar circumstances is most apposite and applicable,
and the operations of any belligerent power are active and efficient, crip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pled
or successful in proportion to the quantum of available means to
carry on its measures offensive and defensive. In this state we find our<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves,
with every basis of permanent income, and every source of reve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nue
of a civilized people possessing an area of 250,000 square miles of
territory—an agricultural community of upwards of 50,000 souls, already
reaping the fruits of their hardy labours and enterprize, and an extended
sea cost with fine bays and harbours inviting the commerce of the world.</p>

<p>Where are these resources? What do they consist of? and to what
amount are they available ? An answer to these questions will con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stitute
the report of your committee.</p>

<p>What are the resources of Texas? and what do they consist of?</p>

<p>If a geographical test only were applied the answer would soon be
given. Point to the map and compare the area of Texas, with that of any
state of the United States of America, and we shall find that she com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prises,
within her limits, as much territory as four of the largest states
of the Union put together, to wit: New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and Ohio, or if we consider her with reference to the sustension of a
dense population, and her consequent ability to support the expenses of
a Government, we must assign her a station immeasurably above some

<pb n="594" xml:id="P0594" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/602/" />

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

of the independent kingdoms of Europe, the amount of whose agricultu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ral
productions, and whose commercial and other advantages, place them
far below the standard of our prospective rank among the nations of
the earth. But we must now confine ourselves to the consideration of
Texas, with reference to her capability of raising a revenue and laying the
basis, and establishing a permanent system of taxes and imposts for the
present and future operations of the government. The source from which
this state must derive one. of her certain permanent incomes is the sale
of her public domain, and her indubitable right to tax every acre of land
within her limits to defray the expenses of her government.</p>

<p>The whole of Texas comprised between the Sabine and Rio Grande,
is computed to contain 250,000 square miles, and only a very small por<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of this domain has been granted to individuals or settlers, say 10,<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />000,000
of acres, this amount is acknowledged to be a proper subject of
revenue, inasmuch as the tax can be fixed upon each acre, admitting that
each acre of land were taxed one cent, a direct tax would amount to 100,<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />&gt;000
dollars.</p>

<p>The sale of the public domain, the manner and form of which, it is
to be hoped will hereafter be regulated and prescribed by a policy more in
accordance with its enhanced value, superinduced by our recent change
in Government, will prove if properly nurtured a fruitful source of reve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nue.</p>

<p>The amount of receipts into the Treasury of the United States of
America, from this source, has since their existence as a nation been
upwards of a million of dollars per annum, and by a comparison of the
extent of the public domain of Texas, with that of the United States, we
can fairly compute our amount of revenue at one-fourth of that sum, say
250,000 dollars per annum,from the sale of our public lands; but these data
are necessarily computable and present only a plan of revenue, not im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately
available for the expenses of the current year, inasmuch as the
establishment of a direct tax, the tardy operation of its collection, the pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />liminary
surveys, and sale of the public lands, all require time for their
rendition into available means to defray the pressing exigencies of the
State. A direct tax on slaves, comes next in order as a subject of certain
revenue, and your committee recommend a tax of one dollar on all slaves
in Texas over fourteen and under fifty years of age.</p>

<p>Your committee have, therefore, sought for some plan of internal reve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nue,
simple in its character, less expensive in its nature, and unattended
by preliminary statutes and regulations, tardy in their formation, and
still more dilatory in their execution and returns.</p>

<p>The first subject presenting itself as a speedy and available source of
revenue, is the duty on foreign tonnage. It must be confessed that this
branch of the revenue must be small but progressive, and governed by
the amount of commerce and the consequent number of vessels engaged
in our trade. Your committee have not been able from the state of
things heretofore existing, to obtain an accurate return of the number
of vessels actually engaged in the commerce of Texas, but we may assure
ourselves that the number will certainly be increased tenfold, when the
position we have assumed as a State, “Sovereign and Independent” shall
become more generally known, and the tide of emigration to this favored
land, shall have wafted to our shores, a double, tripple, nay a quadruple
population.</p>

<pb ed="unknown" n="47" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>From the best information obtained from various sources, there were
shipped last year from the different ports of Texas about thirty thousand
bales of cotton. The crops in this fine material, was not so great, nor the
quantity of land appropriated to the culture of this staple, so considerable
as that of the present year by one hundred per cent, and we may there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
estimate our export of cotton at 60,000 bales.</p>

<p>The vessels required for this service agreeably to the best data obtained
on this subject, require a tonnage of one to each bale, not for the purpose
alone of transporting this number of bales, but for return cargoes pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chased
in the United States and Foreign countries, from the proceeds
of this staple for our Texas market. Assuming this data as correct, and
assuming the rate of tonnage duties at what it was when Texas was a
member of the Confederated States of Mexico, now no more, namely,
$2,12 1-2 cents per ton, the amount derived from this branch of the
revenue, could be fairly estimated at 125,000 dollars.</p>

<p>This may be condensed among the available resources, from which we
are to derive the means of defraying the pressing exigencies of our newly
created Government.</p>

<p>Another sure and certain source of available revenue presents itself
to the consideration of your committee, viz: An export duty on cotton
which it would not be deemed too high to place at one quarter of a cent
per pound. The ease and facility with which this duty can be collected,
and the near approach of the season for the exportation of the article,
must necessarily render this subject of impost, in the opinon of your
committee the first on the list of available means.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore recommend a duty of one quarter of a cent
per pound for every pound of cotton exported out of Texas. Assuming
the amount of bales exported as correct in the preceding item on tonage,
the revenue would be increased by this item of impost about 60,000 dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars.</p>

<p>Imposts or custom duties, upon importations of merchandize in a
country where commerce constitutes an extensive branch of industry is
the most fruitful, as well as the most available source of revenue of the
Treasury, and should be nurtured as well as regulated with the greatest
•care, so as to equalize the tax upon the various commodities imported, in
reference to the several class of consumers, the merchant, the manufac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turer
and the Government itself.</p>

<p>A well regulated tariff is commonly resorted to by the most politic,
among the commercial nations of the civilized world, but in our infant
state with a blank Treasury, your committee recommend a less compli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cated
system, than a • designation of specific duties; a general “ad
valorem” duty in the way of a certain rate per cent, upon the value of
the cargo as shown by the manifest, and regulated' so as to guard against
all frauds and infractions of the revenue.</p>

<p>This plan may be divided into two classes of articles of commerce and
importation. First. Such as are commonly called debenture. Second.
All other merchandize not included in the first class. The first should
be fixed and pay duty or per cent, double the latter, say the first class
to be charged 30 per cent., the second class 15 per cent.</p>

<p>Your committee are decidedly of opinion that this system would bet<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter
suit our present situation and circumstances, and its adoption would

<pb n="596" xml:id="P0596" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/604/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="48" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

necessarily be attended with a smaller number of revenue officers to
carry it into effect.</p>

<p>The establishment by law of ports of entry, and delivery, and the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment
of a Collector, and Deputy Collectors. Surveyors and Inspec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tors,
recommended and nominated by himself, subject to his order and
directions, and accountable to him for the faithful performance of the
duties of their offices, and the Collectors to be subject to the orders of
the Governor and Council, and the laws and regulations to be hereafter
enacted for the Government of this branch of the revenue. The depu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties,
&amp;c., to be located at such points within the District, whether on
the sea-coast or upon the land-frontier, according to its probable ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posure
to infractions of the revenue law.</p>

<p>It will become necessary, in order further to carry into effect the reve<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nue
laws hereafter to be enacted, to divide the whole coast into revenue
districts. Your committee have decided upon the following division of
the coast, which is naturally suggested by its geographical as well as
topographical features.</p>

<p>First. All that part of the coast lying between the Sabine and Caney
creek, comprehending the ports of Sabine, Galveston, and Velasco, and
all others that may be hereafter established within the said limits, to be
called the Eastern district.</p>

<p>Second. All that part of the coast lying between Caney creek and the
Western boundary of Texas, comprehending the ports of Matagorda, La<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vaca,
Copano, and all others which may hereafter be established within
the said limits to be called the Western district.</p>

<p>But your committee cannot conceal the fact, that although the picture
here presented, of the fiscal resources of our infant Government, is flat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tering
and exhilarating in the highest degree, to the patriot and states<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />man,
and that the revenue both permanent and available, is destined to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />become
with proper nursery and management, the physical arm of the
Government, which is to preserve our existence, as a free and enlightened
people, among the nations of the earth. Yet the urgent, pressing, and
unavoidable exigencies and immediate necessities of our State, thus
thrown suddenly into existence and compelled to rely on her own re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sources,
great as they are, but not immediately controllable: in fine, a
people passing from a state of nature to the highest grade of civil society,
and appearing fresh from the parturrition, like Minerva from the head
of Jupiter, panoplied and armed with all the intelligence and strength,
all the vigor and combined action of a nation, long since arrived at
maturity, require a fund to which it can immediately recur, to answer
the urgent calls and pressing demands upon its Treasury.</p>

<p>Your committee have not been able to fix upon a project possessing
in a greater degree all the essential requisites of speedy operation, and
combining celerity and certainty in its accomplishment, than that sug<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gested
by a loan. It is a well ascertained fact that the money market
in the United States, is glutted. at this time with that commodity, and
that should the infant Government of Texas present herself on "change"
she will stand with all her resources and capacities to pay, among the
highest on the list of favoured borrowers.</p>

<p>In presenting to the consideration and sanction of the Council of the
Provisional Government, a measure, not on all occasions deemed politic
or advisable in which the credit of the State, will be brought thus early

<pb n="597" xml:id="P0597" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/605/" />

into competition with other nations, whose institutions and government
have long been established and'organized. Your committee have been
guided and impelled only by a deep conviction of the urgent necessity
of the case, and confidently believe, that both principal and interest of
the debt, will not only be secure and certain, but at no very distant
period entirely refunded from the revenue arising from the various
sources above indicated.</p>

<p>Your committee under these circumstances have drafted a special ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nance
and decree, of which they recommend the immediate adoption by
the Governor and Council, and suggest that its provisions be carried into
effect forthwith.</p>

<p>The ordinance and decrees necessary to carry into effect the sugges<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
contained in this report on the subject of a direct tax, impost
duties, tonnage, &amp;c., will be prepared and arranged as soon as practicable,
to meet properly the subjects referred to.</p>

the Executive to vest him with authorities to fill out the blanks

be a courtesy due to these men to enquire the reasons of their separation

report:</p>

<p>
To the Honorable, the General Council of the
<lb />Provisional Government of Texas:
</p>

<p>Your Special Committee, to whom was referred the letter of Thomas
F. M’Kinney to Judge Dinsmore, report,—</p>

<p>That in common with their fellow-citizens of Texas, your committee
have long known the efficient aid given by Mr. M’Kinney in the cause ■
of our suffering country.</p>

<p>All his acts, connected with objects of a public nature, have evinced
an ardent patriotism and an unbending determination, promptly and
generously to exert his means and his influence in the glorious struggle
for Liberty and our constitutional right.</p>

<p>The ready interposition of Mr. McKinney to save and keep up the credit
of the country under various and trying circumstances, his prompt assump<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of heavy responsibilities, on apparent emergencies, presented to his
own mind, or on request of such temporary authorities as have exercised
Governmental power, before the present organization by the people’s rep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />resentatives,
are acts not to be forgotten by an honest people, nor will
the authorities of this country neglect any thing within their means to
give the necessary pledges for security, and by proper acts and ordinances
guarantee all responsibilities assumed in good faith, designed for the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mon
interests of our citizens. Such encouragement, in times so unsettled,

and fraught with dangers, requiring the ready energies of every member
of the community, should, in the opinion of your committee, be pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />claimed
to the world.</p>

<p>A general confidence in the integrity of a Government by its determi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nation

<p>P. S. Capt. Blair, with his company, has tendered his services, which

when, on motion of Mr. Hanks, the report was adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the Committee on State Affairs and Judiciary, pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sented
the following report:</p>

<p>To the Honorable, the General Council of the
<lb />Provisional Government of Texas:</p>

<p>Your Committee of State, &amp;c., to whom was referred the letter, &amp;c.,
of the Committee of Safety of Nacogdoches, upon the subject of Land.
Offices, &amp;c., report,</p>

<p>That the Committee of Safety of Nacogdoches, when making the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munication
to this House, were evidently uninformed of the proceedings
of the Consultation upon the subject of Land, and Land Offices. The
resolution of the Council, which existed before the meeting, of the Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sultation,
passed, October 27th, is wholly inoperative in its requirements,
and forms no basis for the action of the Provisional Government; and
whatever evils may arise, or benefits result to Texas, from the measure of
suspending all proceedings as regards Land Titles, neither censure nor
credit can be given to that Council.</p>

<p>By the 14th article of the organic law of the Provisional Government,
all Officers and all “persons concerned in the location of lands, are or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dered
forthwith to cease their operations,” and Commissioners are ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed,
for the reasons expressed, to take charge of “all the archives,”
belonging to the different Land Offices, and deposit them, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This article is mandatory, and has no mitigating provision, whatever.
If any article or part of the organic law, passed by the Consultation, by
which the present Government was created, and which alone gives au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thority
to its acts, are regarded as obligatory, and to govern its proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings.
The provisions of no article can be disobeyed; an attempt to annul
any part, would be to deny the power that gave existence to the Provi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sional
Government; consequently, no powers exist in this case, but to.
execute the command of the Consultation.</p>

<p>Already has the Commissioner of the first established Land Office in
Texas, yielded a prompt and honorable acquiescence to the mandates,
of the people’s Representatives. A refractory Commissioner of the Nash<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ville
Colony, will be proceeded against forthwith, and obedience enforced,
and the Officer punished for his contumely and disaffection to the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
of the People. Under such circumstances, the integrity’ and
dignity of the Government would be set at nought, and brought into,
contempt, with the citizens, as affording neither security to their prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty,
or protection to their persons, if it failed in moral energy and physi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cal
power to effect the objects for which it was called into existence. Tne
alternative is therefore obvious, that the Organic Law must be enforced,
and all ordinances and decrees of the Provisional Government, must be
respected and obeyed.</p>

<p>The execution of the 14th article, &amp;c., in the present case, must pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cede
any power of action in the matter on the part of the General Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil;
but as the act itself, purports only the security of the public records
and a guarantee of equal privleges, to those in their country’s service,
with such citizens as remain at home, no pre-existing rights are, or can
be affected; and there can be no doubt as to the powers of the Provi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sional

Government to provide for the completing all incipient titles, in
such a manner as to meet the objects of the Consultation, in the said 14th
article. Expediency and the interest of Texas, must determine the course
of the Council in this, as well as in all other of its actions.</p>

<p>Your Committee, believing that the good citizens of the Nacogdoches
Department, in view of all these facts and necessities, will readily concur
in and give aid to the full execution of the mandates of their own Repre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sentatives
in solemn Convention assembled, can give no other opinion
than that which duty requires of the existing authorities of the people,
and cannot but hope, that all who are contemplated in the provisions of
the 14th article, as before mentioned will submit and yield obedience,
especially when convinced that resistance will not only be vain, but sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject
them to heavy penalties.</p>

<p>Your Committee advise a copy of this report, signed by the President
and Secretary of the General Council, be forwarded to the Committee of

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, the foregoing report was adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett from the Committee on State Affairs and Judiciary, to
whom was referred, “an ordinance and decree for calling a Convention,
&amp;c.," presented the following report:</p>

<p>“By the laws of creation and nature, all men are free and equal; of
these natural rights no man can be forcibly deprived, on the principles
of immutable justice. A desire for domination and power in man, over
his fellow men, subjects the weak and unambitious, to the machinations
of the more subtle and strong. To avoid such evils, social compacts or
governments are formed, for mutual and individual protection, to this
end, each member of a community surrenders certain of his natural
rights for. common security. Thus, of necessity, all the legitimate powers
of any government are immediately derived from the governed. The
people are sovereign, and all the Officers designated for the execution of
this civil compact, are agents, and accountable for their fidelity; when
such agents assume the character of principles or dictators, and attempt
of their own will to subvert the form and true principles of the govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mental
compact, and substitute another, without the consent of the par<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties,
whose agents they are, resistance from the people, is necessary and
a virtue; in this situation are the citzens of Texas, and a considerable
portion of the Mexican Republic, of which Texas is a part; resistance is
therefore a duty. The protection of our liberties, our natural and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />served
rights make it so. Arms are the resort, and in arms the people
will find their only security from the oppression of ambitious tyrants,
whose chains are forged to” manacle our citizens, and subdue them to
their will. Courage and bravery in resistance, and prudence in Council,
will restore to us the natural sovereignty of all governments.</p>

<p>Our civil compact or constitution is destroyed, and another must be
formed to guarantee the purposes and ends of political association. A
provisional or temporary Government, however wisely formed, or pru<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dently
administered, is at best uncertain and insecure. Permanency and

<p>GENTLEMEN:—I herewith transmit for your information, various com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munications
recently received, all of which will show for themselves,
and to some of which I call your particular attention. The documents
in the Castilian language, are said to be the product of an intercepted
correspondence, from the interior authorities of the Central Government
to General Cos, at Bexar. They contain the plans of Santa Anna, for a
vigorous prosecution of the war against Texas, which is determined by
him as a war of extermination.—General Austin informs me, that in one
of his communications he has consolidated the principal matter in a
brief manner. I would therefore recommend that the whole be read
before your body; and such portions translated and published as you
may deem expedient. The printed documents, purporting to be the
acts of the General Congress, establishing and defining the plan of the
Central Government, with some manuscript documents, marked confi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dential,
you may at least deem worthy of publication, together with a
condensed view of the whole subject matter of the intercepted corre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spondence.
The domestic correspondence, herewith accompanying, will
show for itself, and by you will be taken for what it is worth. Some
of the documents are the views and opinions of men, which by you can
be properly appreciated.—Taking a fair view of things as they now seem
to stand, I have no doubt you will agree with me, that every energy and
exertion on our part should he resorted to, to counteract, or meet with
efficiency, the pending storm which overhangs our country. It must be
acknowledged by all, that our only succour is expected from the East,
where as yet we have not dispatched our agents, sufficient time has
-elapsed since the rising of the Convention, for them, by this time, to
have arrived in the United States. They have called on me, in vain,
day after day, time after time, for their dispatches, at least some of them,
.and they are not yet ready. I say to you, the fate of Texas depends upon

their immediate dispatch and success. Why then delay a matter of such
Vital importance, and give place to minor matters which could be much
better delayed? Permit me to beg of you a suspension of all other busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness,
until our Foreign Agents are dispatched.</p>

<p>I would further suggest to your body the propriety of passing a bill,
authorising the Executive to issue his proclamation, calling upon the
different Jurisdictions, to send Delegates to a new Convention, to meet
in conformity with the Organic Law, and the elections to be as soon as
practicable, and that the Members be clothed with plenary powers, and
that in forming the bill, you apportion the Representatives as nearly as
possible, on the principles of equality.</p>

<p>The proceedings of our former Convention have not yet appeared be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
the public. A circumstance well and justly calculated to bring down
upon us the public censure and odium of the whole community. The
Committee charged with that trust, by the Convention, justly merits
reprehension, and a vote of public censure for the neglect and contumely
with which they have treated the public confidence.</p>

<p>With sentiments,</p>

<p>Of the highest respect, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

<p>I am Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>“Resolved that the prisoners taken at Goliad, (Col. Sandoval, and

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the foregoing resolution was adopted.</p>

<p>The report accompanying it was ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the same committee, presented the following report,
and resolution:</p>

<p>“We the Committee on Military Affairs, to whom was referred the
letter of Thomas Hooper, dated Alexandria, 30th October, 1835, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spectfully
report unto the General Council, that we have examined the
contents of said letter, and after mature deliberation would suggest the
propriqty of a letter being addressed by the Governor in answer to the
said Thomas Hooper’s letter, expressive of our heartfelt thanks for the
aid which he and his friend Capt. E. Anderson tenders to us in our strug<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gle
for Constitutional Liberty against despotism. For the services of
more men than can be possibly raised in our own state, will be required
to repel the repeated attempts that will be made by the native Mexicans
to invade our country. That military rule and the most dire oppression
is the intention of the Centralists, can no longer be questioned, should
they triumph over us. For we may expect not only a Christian war<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fare,
but a war of extermination from our enemies; therefore, we should
not hesitate in accepting the services of those who are willing to rally
around the standard we have raised in defence of the rights and immuni<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties
which belong to us as freemen. It was the succour which the United

States obtained from France, that generally contributed to their triumph
over so formidable an enemy as that of England.</p>

<p>It is the citizens of that Government which commands the respect
and admiration of the world, who offer to peril their lives in defence of
our rights and liberties. Could we refuse them? Dare we reject the offer
of their services? It would be worse than madness. On the contrary we
should hold out every inducement to volunteers from abroad.”</p>

<p>The committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following
resolution:</p>

<p>“Resolved, that a certified copy of the ordinances and decrees estab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lishing
the regular army and an auxiliary volunteer corps be forwarded
to Thomas Hooper of Alexandria, La., and that the said Thomas Hooper
be solicited through a letter addressed to him by the Governor to request

conjunction and with the advice of T. F. McKinney, he directed to make
such provision for fitting Gen. Mexia, and his command, at the mouth of
Brazos as will enable them to proceed into the interior, &amp;c., with the object

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT OF Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council.</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN—I have had under consideration the following bills, which
have been passed by your body, viz:</p>

<p>An ordinance and decree changing the manner .of drawing drafts on
the Treasurer, &amp;.</p>

<p>I object to the bill for the following reasons: First, the Committee on
Finance, with whom the whole discretion of appropriating money and
drafting On the Treasury is vested, is like all other Committees belonging
to your body, liable to change and shift its members, as such indiscreet
appropriations might be made, and money drawn for improper uses. That
a bare report to the Council of what has been done in in order that it be
noted in your journals, would afford no check to the act of the Commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee,
because the appropriation and draft on the Treasury would be made
prior to the report of the Committee, and as such they would be left
without check or corrective.</p>

<p>Secondly, I consider that no appropriations of money should be made
except by law. That no committee or separate authority should be priv<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ileged
to make appropriations, or draw money from the Treasury, without
the necessary formalities having been complied with. Acting without
the proper functionaries of Secretary, Comptroller, &amp;c., it would be well
to incorporate in our plan as many checks and balances as would be con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sistent,
without producing complexity. For the foregoing reasons I ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject
to the bill.</p>

<p>The ordinance making it my duty to issue a Special Commission for
the arrest of Wm. H. Steel, I have signed and complied promptly with
its provisions.</p>

<p>The bill creating a Municipality to be called the Municipality of Jack<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son
I have signed, believing that it might afford convenience to the citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens,
but at the same time feel satisfied that both that and the jurisdic<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
from which it is taken, will by that separation be rendered con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />temptible
in numbers, and as such the more heavily burthened with muni<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cipal
taxes. I would recommend to your honorable body, that in future
you confine yourselves solely within the pale of the duties assigned to us.</p>

<p>The bills creating a loan and defining the duties of our Commissioners,
I have signed, and wish every thing done for their immediate dispatch.
I have seen no act of your body which has made any allowance for their .
outfit, or expenses while performing their various and responsible duties,
this matter has certainly escaped your observation, and will, I hope, he
promptly acted on, and that you will place such an amount at their dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />position
as will be ample and sufficient to comport with the dignity of the
station and duties assigned them.</p>

<p>The bills appointing the contractor and treasurer have been signed.
I also transmit to you a communication from M. Caldwell, of Gon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zales,
which speaks for itself, and of which you will make the proper dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />position.</p>

<p>Every thing connected with the dispatch of our commissioners, will, I
hope, meet with the earliest possible dispatch.</p>

<p>I am your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the Committee on Military Affairs, presented the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing
report; which was received.</p>

<p>“Your Committee, to whom was referred the letter of General Sam
Houston, dated, San Felipe de Austin, 4th December, 1835, urging the
immediate necessity of an election of the officers of the regular army,
having had the same under consideration, your Committee can state with
confidence, believing that the statement will at the same time receive a
favorable response from a majority of the General Council, that this
Committee has thrown no impediment or obstacle in the way of raising
the regular army, for the protection of Texas during the present war, as
contemplated by the first article of the organic law of Texas. On the
contrary, it is the opinion of your Committee, that the General Council
has been as expeditious in the enactment of ordinances, the election of
Officers, and every other necessary arrangement, in order to carry into
full force and effect the first article of the organic law, to which our at<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tention
is called by the letter of General Sam Houston, as could be done
under the press of business, and the distracted state of our affairs. Be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sides,
a considerable portion of our time is and must necessarily be con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sumed
in making provision to sustain the “Volunteer Army,” near Bexar.
Upon them rest the hopes and fortunes of the people of Texas.</p>

<p>They have already defended the country against an invading foe, and
are now holding them in check, by remaining in the field; and not to sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain
them, would.be to sacrifice our dearest rights and interests. Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plaints

<pb n="633" xml:id="P0633" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/641/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="85" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

have been made to the General Council, already from said army,
stating that they were in want of the necessary provisions and clothing.
Letters of that nature have been referred to your Committee, which re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired
the immediate action of the General Council, and could not be
overlooked or neglected, under any consideration whatever.</p>

<p>There are many other important reasons, in the opinion of your Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee,
why the General Council should not sooner, or even now, proceed
to appoint all the officers of the regular army.</p>

<p>If the war should be protracted to any considerable length of time,
and reinforcements continue to arrive, as we must expect from the pres<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ent
aspect of affairs, we shall need all the aid from foreign countries that
can possibly be procured. -No quarter from the enemy, or mercy at their
hands, is expected. Successful' resistance, then, is our only hope.—Hence
the importance of holding out every inducement to Volunteers from
abroad. There are doubtless many young men in the United States who
would gladly embrace the opportunity of enlisting into the service of
Texas, provided they could obtain appointments, suited in some degree
to their qualifications. Texas now presents a fine field for those who de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sire
military fame. Your Committee would therefore earnestly recom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mend,
for the consideration of the General Council, the postponement of
the appointment of the officers for five companies of the artillery, for the
present. The object of your Committee in recommending this course,
must be at once seen by the General Council. It is to leave open the door
for promotion, so that if any person should make application for an ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment
in the regular army, who is well recommended, and who can
"bring one or more companies to our assistance, should be promoted to
some office, corresponding with the aid and qualifications of such appli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cant.
If the gate of preferment should once be shut, we must expect to
loose the services of such men. Men of talent, wealth or influence, will
never submit to become privates in a regular army. And it is through
their influence, in a great measure, that volunteers are to be obtained.</p>

<p>Your Committee would also recommend the Governor to issue, or
cause to be issued, his proclamation, to establish head quarters for the
regular army, and for the same to be organized: Also for the organiza<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the Militia, in conformity with an ordinance, passed on November
25th, 1835.</p>

<p>Your Committee would recommend the establishment of head quarters
for the regular army, at Gonzales, or some other suitable place on the
frontier.</p>

<p>Your Committee would further recommend to the General Council,
that on to-morrow, the 7th inst. a lieutenant colonel, for the artillary,
and the regimental officers of the corps of Infantry of the regular army,
be appointed.</p>

<p>As to the outfits of an army, your Committee will simply refer to the
proceedings of the General Council had upon that subject.</p>

<p>WYATT HANKS, Chairman.
<lb />J. D. CLEMENTS, Committee.
</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the Committee on Military Affairs, also presented the
fololwing report; which was adopted:</p>

<p>Your committee would further recommend, that Doctor Asa Hoxie, be
authorised and instructed to address a letter of thanks to the said Dr. M.
Estis, for the services which he tenders us; and inform him at the same
time, that no appointment will be made, until the regular army is organ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized,
as made,and provided for by the organic law of Texas, creating a

also that his name is placed on the list of applicants for the appointment
of Surgeon.</p>

</p>

<p>Mr. Parker presented the following resolutions:</p>

of Texas, in addition to the local Volunteers.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Commander-in-Chief of the forces of Texas, shall
establish his head quarters at such place as he may think best for the

<p>Mr. Hanks presented the following resolution, which was adopted:</p>

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council, that our Foreign Agents shall

presented to Texas, by the citizens of the country which they may visit;
and if said Agents should receive any money or monies, to deposit the
same in some safe Bank, and report the same to the Provisional Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment

<p>Be it further resolved, that a certified copy of this resolution be fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nished

<p>Mr. Millard, from the Committee on Finance, reported an ordinance
and decree, to provide for the outfit and contingent expenses of our For<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eign
Agents, to the United States of the North; which was read the
first time.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Parker, the rule of the House was suspended, and
the ordinance read the second time.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royal, the blank in the first section, was filled by
“five hundred.”</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the blank in the second section was filled
with “two thousand.”</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Power, the rule of the House was further suspended,
and the ordinance read the third time, when the question was taken on
its final passage, and decided in the affirmative. And the ordinance
passed.</p>

<p>The following resolutions were returned by the Governor, approved:</p>

<p>That the preamble and resolutions adopted at the meeting held in the

nature to the people of Texas.</p>

<p>In the generous spirit of a free and magnanimous people, they have
been among the first to tender their aid in our struggle against misrule
and military despotism. A company of men from the city of Mobile has
already passed through our town, armed and equipped for the field, on
their march to join the volunteer army of the people of Texas, near
Bexar: And your Committee is informed by a resolution which was
unanimously adopted at the meeting held in Mobile, and contained in
the proceedings forwarded to us by Joel T. Case, that a Committee was
appointed to solicit contributions in behalf of the people of Texas, and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceive
the names and assist at discretion all volunteers who are disposed
to go to Texas for the purpose of sustaining the people of that country
in their present struggle. They also sympathise with us in our present
conflict, and express their desire to hail the independence of Texas, and
see her taking a seat among the sovereign nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Your Committee are of the opinion that if we receive the assistance
from the United States of the North, which we may reasonably expect
from the evidences already given us, that we shall be able to shake off
the shackles which tyrants and religious bigotry have attempted to bind
us with. Santa Anna, the priest, the enemies of constitutional liberty
throughout Mexico, will tremble when they learn that the blood and
treasure of thousands of the descendants of that patriotic band of heroes,
who triumphed over England in the days of her strength and pride, have
been tendered us in our present struggle for liberty and free institutions.</p>

<p>Your Committee do most earnestly recommend to the General Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil
the importance of soliciting through the Governor and our Foreign
Agents, a continuance of the .aid and assistance already extended to us
by our liberal and patriotic friends in the United States of the North.</p>

<p>Mr. Ayres moxed to fill the blanks with the words “twenty;”
was lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris moved to fiill the blanks with the words "twenty
“ten:” which was agreed to.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker moved to add among the list of articles exempt from duty,
“meat and bread stuffs;” which was agreed to.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall moved to add also to the list, “lumber of all kinds for
building.”</p>

<p>A division of the House was called for on the question, when the
House being equally divided, the President gave the casting vote in favor
of the amendment. So it was adopted.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Ayres, the two dollars, twelve and a half cents ton<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nage

<p>On motion, the Council adjourned to 7 o’clock, p. m.</p>

<head>SEVEN o’clock, P. M.</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The Council resumed the consideration of the ordinance and decree,
establishing and imposing duties of imposts and tonnage.</p>

<p>On motion, the ordinance was amended by incorporating with it, the
provisions of the ordinance establishing revenue districts, &amp;c.; when the
rule of the House was suspended, and the ordinance read the third time,
and the question taken on its final passage, and decided in the affirma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tive.
So the ordinance passed by the following title:</p>

<p>“An ordinance and decree establishing and imposing duties of impost
and tonnage, and for other purposes.”</p>

<p>The Council took up the ordinance and decree for establishing revenue
districts, &amp;c; which, on motion, was indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the Committee on State and Judiciary, presented the
following report:</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred certain proceedings of the peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple
of Nacogdoches, relative to the several Land Offices of that depart<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
and that of the political Chief &amp;c., report that they have considered
all the matters referred, and can find no reasons to alter the views re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ported
by this Committee on the 4th inst.; as that report contains the
true representation, as your Committee believe, of the objects, require<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments,
and duties contemplated in the 14th section of the plan of the
Provisional Government, so far as land affairs are concerned. There<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore,
that this House cannot legally pass any ordinance granting the
power of making titles in any way, until the said 14th article is com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plied
with, at least so far as that the papers and documents are under the
control of the Officers of the Provisional Government; when this shall
have been effected, your Committee have no further hesitation in advis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
that the several legal Commissioners of each Land Office, or some
other person specially appointed, be authorised to proceed in- complet<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
all titles to land made for settlers on surveys, returned before the
passing of the said 14th section. But in doing this, all proper guaran<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tees
against injustice or fraud should be carefully incorporated in the
decree for such purpose.</p>

<p>In the mean time your Committee have confidence in assuring this
Council, and the people at large, that neither the orders of the Conven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
or decrees of the Provisional Government have any other object or

<pb n="641" xml:id="P0641" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/649/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="93" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

effect, than in securing an equal and fair opportunity of all our citizens
to obtain their landed rights; and although the time of perfecting titles
may be extended, no acquired right or privilege either is or can be
effected. The right exists unimpaired, while the bare legal form remains
to be executed.</p>

<p>Your Committee advise that the papers and documents of the Political
Chief of Nacogdoches Department, be committed to the hands and charge
of the Commissioners, but not to be removed until the further directions
of the Provisional Government; for the reason that many individuals
might be subjected to great inconvenience by the removal, and no present
necessity exists for doing so. The functions of the Political Chief are.
extinct. The provisions of the 14th section plainly point out the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />position
of all municipal papers and archives. The late Judges will de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />liver
their documents to their successors in office, appointed by the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Council, and the usual elections for the common offices of Ayunta<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mientos
remain unchanged in character or incidents.</p>

<p>In conclusion, your Committee entertain very high respect for the
general character for patriotism in the present difficulties of the citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens
of the Nacogdoches Department, and their ready obedience to the
laws of their country, and regret that any measure contemplated for. the
general good should operate severely upon individuals. Bu,t in the pres<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ent
case, your Committee can see no real cause of uneasiness or doubt
in the minds of any of our citizens, forasmuch as the security of paper<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />title
is ideal against right, or in further securing absolutely vested rights.</p>

<p>It is an admitted fact, that the revenues of the country will be dimin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ished
for the present, by closing the Land Offices, and that it is inconven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ient
to the Government in the times of such pressing necessity. But
your Committee regard this as the lesser evil, when no injustice can be
the consequence, and great injury and injustice may ensue the opening
of the Land Offices to all common transactions.</p>

<p>Your Committee recommend that another Commissioner be appointed
to act with S. H. Everitt, as it is doubtful whether either of the other
Commissioners will attend to their appointment, and that two shall be
sufficient to perform all the duties contemplated by the 14th section
of the organic law; and while upon this subject, your Committee would
respectfully name to this House, Arthur Henrie, whose character and
qualifications render him a very fit person to exercise the trust and exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cute
any future orders, in conjunction with Mr. Everitt, as may origi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nate
from the Provisional Government for their direction.</p>

for the army.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris presented the following resolution; which was adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Governor be directed to instruct the Commissioners
to the United States to contract with one or more Bakers, for and on
account of the Government, to proceed to this place or the Seat of
Government, and report themselves to the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall, from the Committee appointed to wait on the Governor,
reported verbally that they had discharged that duty and that the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor
would return the resolution with his views on the same to-morrow.</p>

some time spent therein, the doors were opened.</p>

<p>The President laid before the Council a communication from James

<p>Mr. Clements, by leave, introduced an ordinance and decree for the

<p>The Executive Secretary presented the following message from his
Excellency the Governor.</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable President and Council:</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—I herewith transmit to your honorable body the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing
bills; which I have had under consideration:</p>

<p>The one authorising persons to be appointed to make provisions for
General Mexia, &amp;c. The bill, as it stands, I can not approve for the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing
reasons:</p>

<p>First—I have no confidence in General Mexia co-operating in the
smallest degree in our favor. That his intention to make a descent on
the sea-ports West of us, for the purpose of robbing, to recorporate his
own desperate fortune, I have no doubt, but can see no possible advantage
he would be to Texas. What his designs or intentions really are, I have
no right to know. But really think it would be unwise to run this Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
to the expense necessary to fit him out, without having any
guarantee or control over him or his conduct. Furthermore, as the bill
runs, it would seem that the outfit would be made before this Goverment

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

would be advised of his plans. Besides, I consider it bad policy to fit
out or trust Mexicans in any matter connected with our Government,
as I am well satisfied that we will in the end find them inimical and
treacherous. For these and many other reasons not enumerated, I can
not sign the bill. Three other bills which I have transmitted to you"
I have approved.</p>

<p>With sentiments, &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>

<p>I am Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>December 9, 1835.</p>

<p>The Council proceeded to consider the resolution returned by the
Governor, viz: "A resolution authorising William Pettus and T. F. Mc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />Kinney
to fit out General Mexia and his command.” The resolution
together with the objections were read; when the question was put:</p>

<p>“Shall this resolution pass, the veto of the Governor to the contrary not<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />withstanding?”</p>

<p>The ayes and noes being desired, stood as follows:</p>

<p>AYES.—Messrs. Menifee, Barrett, Clements, Parker, Millard, Harris,

and decree to provide for the outfit and contingent expenses of
out Foreign Agents to the United States of the North.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard presented the following resolution; which was ordered to
lie on the table.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Genera] Council is incompetent to act in any way
upon the appointment of William H. Wharton, as commissioner to the
United States of the North, and that this Council can only expect Mr.
Wharton to fulfil the appointment made by the General Consultation.</p>

<p>Mr. Menifee submitted a letter from Mosely Baker, Esq. respecting
the situation of the volunteer army; which was read.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, Col. Rusk was invited within the bar to

Council the necessity of their being relieved immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris presented the following resolution; which was adopted:</p>

<p>Whereas the Provisional Government of Texas, have received informa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of which there is no doubt, that the enemy have large reinforce<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments

with the forces now at Bexar, our small but patriotic army will be
compelled to retire, being overpowered by four times their numbers:
therefore, be it resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
of Texas, that General Mexia be, and he is hereby invited, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether
with the brave officers and men under his command, to repair

and extend all the aid in his power, with authority to draw on
this Government for any amount of money necessary in forwarding the.
objects of said resolutions.</p>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, from the select committee appointed to provide expresses
for the army, &amp;c.; presented the following report:</p>

<p>Your committee to whom, was referred the duty of preparing horses
for expresses to the army now at Bexar, report, the riders for the express
being provided for, only a horse to pack the ammunition was wanting,
which lack was supplied by Doctor Charles B. Stewart, in the liberal

<p>D. PARKER, Chairman.</p>

<p>The foregoing report was accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks stated that Mr. Hoxie resigned his seat in the Council.

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the select committee to prepare an address, &amp;c.,

<p><hl rend="italics">To the people of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>We, the undersigned, having been appointed by the General Council
of Texas, a committee for the purpose of drafting an address to you,
and preparing resolutions on the subject of our gallant army now before
Bexar, approach this subject with great diffidence, and under a full view
of the deep responsibility which rests upon us, in the discharge of this
important duty.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to go back and trace the causes which have
led us in the defence of our constitutional rights, into the present war
with the minions of a tyrant. It is sufficient that we are now in the war,
and that a noble and heroic band, composed of our fellow citizens, and
disinterested patriots from the United States of the North, are now in
an exposed and critical situation, before the walls of a strong fortress
of the enemy, and have, as you will see by the accompanying letter, (the
letter of B. R. Milam and Edward Burleson, of December 6th,) made an
appeal to you through this Council, for ammunition and reinforcements.
They are contending without the necessary munitions of war, and with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
the usual comforts extended to armies, against a force more than
equal in number to them, and who are well supplied with ammunitions
and strongly fortified. And from information of a positive character in
our possession, the enemy will be, if they have not been already rein<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forced
by large numbers. If your army is not immediately reinforced,
they will be forced to retreat or be slaughtered. Will you abandon this
army, who have marched to the field of danger at the first tocsin of
alarm? Will you give the enemies of the constitution, and the hireling .
slaves of a tyrant, the first victory?—Will you destroy the last hopes of
the “Liberals” of the Mexican Republic? Will you disappoint the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pectations
of your friends? Will you compromise your own honor?
Will you expose the defenceless women and children of the frontier to
the ravages of an enemy, whose only check to their conduct, is the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tent
of their power? No, you will not! Rise up, then, with one accord,
and shoulder your rifles, march to the field of battle, and teach the hire<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lings

J. Rusk, be and are hereby constituted agents or contractors for sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plying
ammunitions, provisions and other necessaries for carrying into

with full powers, to purchase any and all articles necessary for said vol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />unteers,
upon the faith of the Provisional Government, or if not other<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />wise
to be procured to take such articles, and to press horses, teams,

and issue to the troops so volunteering, as they may deem neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary
and to the interest of the Government, in all cases taking the proper

<p>Be it further resolved, that the said agents or contractors shall keep
the Council regularly advised of their proceedings and of whatever in
their opinion may be required of the General Council, to give aid and
comfort to all the brave volunteers now in the field, in their country’s
service.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved, that the preceding report and resolutions be
printed and circulated throughout Texas.</p>

<p>Resolved, that this House appoint the following persons to act in con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cert
with Col. Fannin for carrying into effect the objects of the above
resolutions.</p>

relief of the army of the people, now before Bexar, respectfully re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port,
that we have prevailed with Doctor Hoxie to proceed to the town
of Washington, to forward on immediately fifteen kegs of powder and
some lead, the quantity not known, and that Doctor J. H. Forsyth has
started to Libertv and Beaumont for ammunition.
That your com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
has been informed that there is
at the former place, eight kegs
of powder and some lead, and six or eight kegs of powder and some lead

at the latter place; all of which we have no hesitation in saying will soon
be on the road to Bexar. And your committee further state, that the
above named gentlemen will get as many volunteers as possible, to march
forthwith to Bexar.</p>

<p>C. WEST, Chairman.</p>

<p>The foregoing report was accepted.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the House proceeded to consider the two
reports from the select committee, respecting a convention laid on the
table on the 7th inst.; after some discussion, the report of the majority,
and the resolutions for calling a convention to meet on the first of
March, 1836, were adopted and passed.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard from the committee on enrollments, reported as duly en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rolled,
“a resolution authorizing the Treasurer to draw on McKinney
and Williams in favor of Baker and Bordens.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, presented the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing
report:</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the letter of Capt. P. Dimit,
together with the intercepted circular from Matamoras, and the letter of
the late commandant at Le Pantielan, have had the same under consid<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eration,
and the information given to us from the communications, are
of such an important nature as to require immediate action of the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Council.</p>

<p>Your committee would recommend the importance of strengthening
the position occupied by Capt. Dimit at Goliad, by sending reinforce<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments
immediately to his aid, were it not that the volunteer army of the
people of Texas, requires all the men and ammunition that can be raised,
in order to sustain them in their present position before Bexar. It is
important for the safety and protection of Texas to keep possession of the
military post at Goliad. And from the last communication received
from the volunteer army near Bexar by express, informing us that three
hundred of our troops had taken possession of a part of San Antonio,
and were in want of men and ammunition to sustain the position they
had gained, and that'the central troops under the command of General
Cos were daily expecting a large reinforcement under the command of
Col. Ugartechea. Therefore, your committee is of opinion that Capt.
Dimit need not apprehend any danger of an attack by the superior num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber
of central troops under command of Col. Ugartechea at present.</p>

<p>Agents have been dispatched to Yew Orleans for the purpose of pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chasing
and forwarding as early as possible, provisions and supplies for
the army. All that your committee can recommend for the relief of
Captain Dimit in the present emergency, is the adoption of the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
resolution:</p>

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council, that John Eagan be, and he is
hereby appointed a commissary, and that the said commissary be and he
is hereby authorized and empowered to purchase provisions and such
supplies, as the company of troops under the command of Capt. Dimit
at Goliad requires; and that orders be drawn upon the Provisional Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
for the same by said commissary: Provided nevertheless, said
provisions cannot be purchased, the said commissary be, and he is here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />by
authorized to press the same for the use of said troops.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved, that a certified copy of this report and resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions,
and of the communication last received from the commander of

the volunteer army before Bexar, be furnished by the Secretary of the
General Council and forwarded to Capt. Dimit, commandant at Goliad,
and also a copy of the resolution inviting General Mexia to co-operate
with the volunteer army of the people near Bexar, by way of Goliad.</p>

<p>WYATT HANKS, Chairman.
<lb />J. D. CLEMENTS, Committee.
<lb />R. R. ROYALL, Committee.
</p>

<p>The foregoing report and resolutions having been read, were adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett submitted a communication from Hugh Frazer, in prison
at Goliad; when the following resolution was adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved, that Capt. Dimit be directed to discharge Mr. Frazer, or to
send him to this place, with the charges against him.</p>

<p>On motion, the Council adjourned to 9 o’clock to-morrow morning.</p>

</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The Journals of yesterday’s proceedings having been read, .Mr. Royall
presented as duly enrolled,</p>

<p>An ordinance and decree establishing and imposing duties of imposts<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />and
tonnage, and for other purposes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Millard from the committee on enrollments, presented as duly
enrolled,</p>

<p>A resolution for calling a convention to meet on the first day of
March, 1836.</p>

<p>By leave, General Houston submitted a proclamation, which he was
about to issue; which was read and approved.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, it was resolved, that the committee on mili<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tary
affairs be instructed to prepare a supplemental ordinance increasing
the bounty of soldiers of the regular army to 800 acres of land, and 24
dollars in money, one half to be paid when mustered into service, and
the other half three months after.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett presented as duly enrolled,</p>

<p>The ordinance and decree establishing a post office department, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether
with an additional section, fixing the compensation of the Post
Master General; which was adopted as part of the ordinance.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard moved that Messrs. Barrett and Padilla be added to the
committee appointed some days since, to draft an address to the Mexican
people, which was agreed to.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Millard, it was resolved, that the Council will this
evening, at half past six o’clock, proceed to elect the company officers
for five companies of artillery of the regular army, and also the munici<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pal
officers of San Patricio.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris, from the committee to prepare an address to the Mexican
people, reported an address in the Spanish language prepared by Mr.
Padilla, of which the following is a translation:</p>

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p><hl rend="italics">The General Council of the Provisional Government of Texas to the
<lb />Mexican people.</hl></p>

<p>The people of Texas have taken up arms in defence of their rights and
liberties, menaced by the attacks of military despotism, and to sustain the
republican principles of the constitution of 1824. The Mexican nation
ought to be fully informed on this subject, in order to correct the false<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hoods
circulated by the Centralists, who have attempted to calumnate
the Texians by giving to the revolution here, a character very different
from the true one, and painting it in the blackest colors.</p>

<p>Texas has solemnly declared her principles in the declaration of the
7th November last, made by its representatives, and has called God to
witness the sincerity and purity of her intentions. The people of Texas
could not have acted in any other manner, and every freeman would
have done the same who appreciates his own dignity and was able to
resist slavery.</p>

<p>Texas was left without any government, owing to the imprisonment
and dispersion of the Executive and Legislative authorities of the state
by the military Centralists, and every thing was rapidly falling into
anarchy and ruin. It certainly was not the fault of the Texians that this
state of things existed. They were living in .peace when the revolution<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ary
flame reached their homes, their situation may be compared to that
of a peaceful village that is suddenly assailed by a furious hurricane,,
which menaces ruin and death, from which the inhabitants seek safety
by any means in their power, without being in any manner censurable
for the impending danger, nor for trying to shield themselves from its
effects. The truth is, that a storm which originated elsewhere, threat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ened
to involve them in its desolating ravages. They wish to save them<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
as they have a right to do, by the law of nature.</p>

<p>Faithful to their oaths, they wished to defend the constitution, and
for this their enemies have declared a war of extertermination against
them, and are trying to deceive the liberal Mexicans with false reports
that their objects are different from those expressed in the before-men<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioned
declaration. God knows this to be a malicious calumny, circu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lated
for the purpose of consolidating centralism, by trying to unite the
Federalists in its ranks against their friends the Texians.</p>

<p>Very dearly indeed have the Texians acquired their homes in this
country, which but a short time since was a wilderness infested by hos<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tile
Indians. It is just and natural that they should wish to preserve
them, in conformity with the guarantees of the Federal compact under
which they were acquired. It is equally so, that they should obey the
first law which God has stamped upon the heart of man civilized or sav<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age,
which is self-preservation.</p>

<p>The Texians have therefore taken up arms in the defence of their
constitutional rights, in fulfilment of their duties to the Mexican con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />federation
and of the most sacred obligations to themselves.</p>

<p>They have organized a Provisional local Government, to provide for
their security as a part of the Mexican confederation should it again be
re-established. Can it be possible that the whole nation will declare war
against us because we wish to comply with our obligations in favor of
the constitution, and because we wish to defend the rights which God
has given to man, and which the Mexican nation has solemnly guaran<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />teed

to us? No, it cannot be believed. The free Mexicans are not un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />just,
and they will take part in our favor.</p>

<p>To arms then patriotic Mexicans. The Texians although a a young
people, invite and call you to the contest which is the duty of all to sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain
against the perjured centralists, separate as we have done from the
Central Government, and declare eternal war against it, let us sustain the
federal compact, restore the federal system and firmly establish the lib<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erties
and happiness of our country. In this great work you will receive
aid and assistance from the Texians, so far as their limited resources will
permit, as they have offered in the second article of their declaration.</p>

<p>The foregoing address having been read, it was resolved that it be
signed by the officers of the Council, and all the members present, and
that 500 copies be printed in Spanish, and 200 copies in English.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett presented the following resolution; which was adopted

<p>Resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government of
Texas, That our highly esteemed and patriotic fellow-citizen, General
Stephen E. Austin, being again about to leave his country, to subserve
her interests, and give a higher tone to her destinies in the land of our
nativity, as the friend and public agent of Texas, that the grateful re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spects
of this Council for themselves and in behalf of their fellow citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens
of Texas, be tendered to General Austin, and that in rendering
this just tribute of affection, we are impressed with a deep sense of his
past sufferings and privations, while laboring in our case and for our.
good in the city of Mexico, and sympathise in his afflictions and almost
broken, constitution, consequent upon a long and painful confinement,
for boldly standing forth for the rights of Texas, in the strong hold of
her oppressor, and that we congratulate our country in being possessed
of such an agent to represent us among the free sons of the North, in
whose aid we repose our strongest hopes, in our present conflict for free<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dom
and existence, and that we extend to him the hand of parting love
and greeting, with hopes of his success and speedy return to the bosom
of his grateful countrymen: And that a copy of this resolution, signed
by the officers and members of the General Council be presented to Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Austin before he departs from us to accomplish the wishes and hopes
of his friends.</p>

<p>The foregoing was signed and presented to General Austin.</p>

<p>On motion the Council adjourned to 3 o’clock p. m.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">
To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Coumcil:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen—I herewith transmit to your honorable body a com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munication
from Capt. Dimit, commander of the volunteer forces at

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH,

<p>Austin, Dec. 10th, 1835.</p>

<p>The letter alluded to in the above message, was referred to the commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee

was committed to a select committee of three.</p>

<p>Messrs. Clements, Royall and Parker were appointed that committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard from the committee on finance, made a verbal report, rec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ommending

<p>Mr. Millard presented the following resolution, which was adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved, There shall be appointed by the President, a standing com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
of public accounts, to consist of one member from each of the
principal standing committees, except the committee of finance, with
the chief clerk of the state and judiciary and finance committees, who

<p>It shall be the further duty of said committee to receive, audit and

the title and amount of said accounts, in such a manner as to show

<p>Messrs. Royall, Parker, West and Kerr were appointed that committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Menifee was appointed to the standing committee on state and
judiciary.</p>

<p>The resolution offered by Mr. Millard and laid on the table yesterday,

<p>On motion, Messrs. Kerr and West were appointed a committee to wait

<p>The President submitted the following letter from General Austin,
in reply to the resolution passed by the House yesterday.</p>

<head>San Felipe De AUSTIN,
<lb />December 11th, 1835.</head>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>I have received, with the most lively emotions of gratitude, the resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
passed by the honorable Council this day, expressing its respect for
my acts as the public agent for Texas, to Mexico in 1833, and kind wishes
for my health and success on the important mission to the United States.
Nothing but obedience to the call of the Representatives of the people,
which is due from every citizen when the country is in danger, could
have induced me to leave here at so critical a time as this, or to have'
separated from the volunteer army. A crisis has arrived in the affairs of
Texas. I am of opinion that the people ought to form a constitution,
and organize a permanet Government without delay, in conformity with
the declaration of the seventh of November last, especially with the fifth
article, and without making any change in the principles of that , declara<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion.
This can only be done by a Convention of Texas, elected on the
basis of equality of representation so far as possible to obtain it.</p>

<p>I must take this occasion to express my thanks for the measures lately
adopted to sustain the volunteer army now in the field, and also for the'
aid which has been given to the native Mexican forces of the federal
party, in conformity with the second article of the declaration of the
seventh of November last. I consider these measures to be the most im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portant
that could have been adopted at this time.</p>

<p>With the highest respect, and the most ardent wishes for the prosperity
and happiness of our country, under a constitutional and permanently
organized Government, I have the honor to present my best wishes for
the health of the members of the Council, individually.</p>

<p>And to remain their most</p>

<p>Obedient servant,</p>

<p>S. F. AUSTIN.</p>

<p>To the President and Members
<lb />of the Honorable Council.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Harris, resolved, that a copy of the resolution, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether
with General Austin’s reply, be furnished the printers of the Tele<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />graph,
for publication.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall offered a resolution for establishing correspondence with
agents in the United States; which was referred to a select committee
of three.</p>

<p>Messrs. Royall, Barrett and McMullen were appointed the committee..
Mr. Hanks offered the following resolution; which was adopted:</p>

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council, that the Secretary of the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral

of the regular army of Texas, with a list of the officers elected for the

where and when appointed, together with a copy of all the ordinances
and decrees relating to the regular army, and auxiliary volunteer corps.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks offered the following resolution; which was adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved, that when any uncertainty as to the rank of officers of the
regular army of the same grade shall arise, seniority of rank shall be de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />termined
by drawing numbers; which shall be done by order of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manding
general, agreeably to the provisions of the section of an ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nance
and decree, entitled an ordinance and decree to organize and es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablish
an auxiliary volunteer corps to the army of Texas, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Parker, the House took up the resolutions offered
by him a few days since, authorizing the commanding general to receive
at least five thousand volunteers, and to fix his head quarters; when the
second resolution was stricken out, and the following substituted:</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Governor be required to issue his order to the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manding
general of the army of Texas, to remove his head quarters to
Washington until further orders; when the resolutions were passed.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Clements, resolved, that a special committee of
three be appointed by the General Council, to ascertain why the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings
of the consultation, and General Council have not been pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished,
also what progress has been made in printing them, and report
instanter.</p>

<p>Messrs. Clements, Hanks and Harris were appointed said committee.</p>

<p>The Executive Secretary presented the following message from the
Governor:</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMIENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council:</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>I transmit to your body various bills, which I have considered and
signed.</p>

<p>The one with resolutions requiring me to communicate with the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
at the city of Mobile, for the purposes therein named, I have not
as yet complied with, nor am I at present in a situation to do so promptly ;
as my health is bad and my situation quite uncomfortable, but hope in
a few days to be better situated to discharge the functions of my office.
I have signed the. revenue, post office and many other bills and resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
of minor importance, all of which I transmit to you, with one to
call a convention, not approved, inasmuch as I consider it in some degree
exceptionable. My objections are confined to the third and seventh ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ticles,
and are these.</p>

<p>That the Mexican population within our limits, particularly where they
are unmixed with other population, could not be tested at an election to
know whether they were in favor of centralism or not, that being the
touch stone for elligibility. Under existing circumstances, I consider
one fact plain and evident, that they who are not for us must be against
us. In my own opinion they should be so considered and treated.—
Actions always speak louder than words, and a very great proportion of
the inhabitants of Bexar afford fair examples. They have had, it is well
known, every opportunity to evince their friendship by joining our stand<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ard.
With very few exceptions they have not done it, which is evidence;

<pb n="659" xml:id="P0659" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/667/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="111" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

strong and conclusive, that they are really our enemies. In many in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stances,
they have been known to fight against us. I therefore consider
that they should be neither entitled to our respect nor favor, and as such,
not entitled to a seat in our Council. As it respects the other Mexican
jurisdictions, where the touch-stone could be more properly applied, it
would be different. I therefore hope that you will reconsider the bill,
and make the alterations suggested, as I consider the objections rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sonable
and justly founded.</p>

<p>With sentiments, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, made the following
report, accompanied by an ordinance, increasing the bounty to soldiers
in the regular army.</p>

<p>“Whereas the good people of Texas having dared to resist tyranny
and oppression, following the experience which all nations have taught;
that it is more easy to maintain, than to wrest back usurped rights.
Hence we are involved in a civil war. The usurper and despot, with their
hireling soldiery, have not only trampled under foot the sacred constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
of our country, but are aiming their blows at the life and liberty
of every citizen. A portion of our fellow citizens are now battling against
our enemies, the minions of power and despotism, under the walls of
San Antonio. They cry to us for more assistance. The enemy is daily
expecting a large reinforcement. Perhaps at this moment the volunteer
army is engaged in deadly strife with twice their number; and their
enemies too, strongly fortified. Fearful odds! Your committee there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
earnestly recommend to the General Council the importance and
necessity of increasing the bounty of those persons who enlist in the
regular army, in order to complete the military establishment to the full
number authorized by the organic law, with all possible dispatch, by
so doing, greater inducements are held out to persons to enlist in the
regular army. In accordance with these views, and to effect the speedy
raising and organizing the army, your committee recommend the adop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the accompanying ordinance.</p>

<p>The report was received, and the ordinance read the first time.
On motion of Mr. Millard, the rule was suspended, and -the ordinance
read the second and third time, when the question was taken on its final
passage, and decided in the affirmative.</p>

raise the revenue and custom house laws, which was adopted; and Messrs.
Linn, Royall, Harris and M'Mullen were appointed the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Menifee from the committee to enquire why the ordinances and
decrees have not been published, and also why the Mexican prisoners
have not been removed to San Augustine, presented the following report,
which was accepted:</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the within resolution, respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
report that your committee waited on the Governor, whose duty it
was made by an ordinance, to have the printing done, who says that he
has deferred the printing of the ordinances, until the acts of the conven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion

<p>To General Edward Burleson. Colonel F. Johnson and all the brave
officers and soldiers of the citizen volunteer army in Bexar:</p>

<p>Fellow Citizens :—</p>

<p>The Representatives of your General Council, were this hour greeted
with the welcome intelligence of your glorious victory and triumphant
conquest, over the post of Bexar, with all your enemies prisoners,
together with all the arms, munitions and provisions. We expected no
less from our heroic citizens, and brave compatriots of our northern
brethren.—We felt that you were invincible, and that our enemies, al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />though
greatly out-numbering you, must yield to the sons of freedom.
Their cause is that of oppression and tyranny, ours, that of liberty and
equal rights. They are but the hireling slaves of an usurper. You are

the brave sons of Washington and freedom, and you have proved your<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
worthy of your glorious origin. You have fulfilled the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pectations
of your country, and the hopes of all the lovers of liberty
on earth. Your Representatives extend to you the cordial hand of con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gratulation
and gratitude, as well in behalf of our fellow-citizens and our
families, as for themselves. You have nobly and valiantly acquitted your<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
of the high trust which your country’s danger caused you to as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sume,
and your names will be enrolled in the first pages of your coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try’s
history of heroes, as well as imprinted on the hearts of your fellow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />citizens.
But in the midst of joy there is mourning, and “while we shout
your victory, the tears of holy sorrow bedew our faces. The brave and
heroic Milam has fallen in the arms of victory; and the cause of his in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jured
country. In him we have lost a precious gem from the casket of
brilliant heroes. God rest his soul! while his memory shall survive as
long as a freeman -has a standing in Texas.</p>

<p>Other brave men have also mingled their blood with their country’s
sacrifices. Their honor is imperishable. That your first noble example
may be followed, is the ardent wish of your Representatives, whose ef<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forts
in their sphere have been anxiously directed for your aid and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fort;
and had your country’s means at command been equal to her gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erous
gratitude, your every want had been promptly supplied.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">Citizen Soldiers:</hl>—Many of you have long been in the field of honor
and of danger, separated from your families and your homes. A respite
from your labors and your privations must be desirable; and it is reason<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able,
in anticipation of this glorious event to be achieved by your arms.
Your government have been solicitously engaged in organizing a regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lar
army, upon a proper footing, together with provisions for an auxiliary
volunteer corps, that you might be released and get rest among your
families and friends, until the future calls of your country again place
you in defence of her, and your just rights. To such calls your have
always proved your hearty response. We address you in much haste, but
with feelings not to be repressed. Your joy is our joy, your sorrows our
sorrow's; and with assurance of unabating sympathies with you, and all
our fellow-citizens in the present glorious epoch in our country’s annals,</p>

<p>We are trulv vour</p>

<p>FELLOW CITIZENS AND FRIENDS.</p>

<p>Your committee offer the following resolutions for the consideration of
the Council:</p>

<p>Resolved, That this council sensibly feel the great loss that Texas has
sustained in the death of the brave Colonel Benjamin R. Milam, who fell
while leading his heroic countrymen to victory, and that the President
and members of the General Council, in testimony of their heart-felt sor<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />row,
and mourning for his death, will wear crape on the left arm for
thirty days; and request that the Governor and all the officers of the Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visional
Government, do in like manner unite with us m wearing this
badge of mourning.</p>

<p>Resolved, that his Excellency the Governor, be respectfully invited to
unite with the President and Council in this address to the volunteer
army, and place his name officially to the same, and to the foregoing
resolutions; and that a copy be forthwith sent to the commander of the

of the country, and as a just testimony of respect to patriotism and

<p>Bexar has fallen! Our brave citizen volunteers, with a persevering
bravery and heroic valor, unparallelled in the annals of warfare, have
triumphed over a force of twice their number and compelled the slaves
of despotism to yield, vanquished by the ever resistless arms of freemen
soldiers. We have not time to enter into full detail of all that preceded
the glorious Thursday of December the tenth, when the final capitula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of Cos and Ugartechea, was signed. From Saturday morning pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceding

buildings near the public square of the city, an unceasing battle raged
until Wednesday, with constant advantage gained by our volunteers, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />til
the whole force of the enemy was driven within their last strong hold
across the river, the Alamo; on Wednesday night, Colonel Ugartecha, ef<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fected
an entrance into that place, with a reinforcement of Mexicans,
supposed to amount to three hundred men; this day the black flag was
raised by General Cos. He fought with a desperation worthy a better
cause; but in vain! The unconquerable Texians, with their equally
brave auxiliaries from the United States of the North, could not be dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lodged,
and the battle raged with murderous fury, with advantage to
us, and to the discouragement of the enemy, who became dismayed and
disheartened in a contest that but weakened them, and strengthened our
valorous brethren in arms, raised the signal of submission.</p>

<p>A treaty was entered into, by which all the cannon, a number of small
arms, and a large quantity of munitions of war, and provisions were sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rendered
to- the conquerors. All the enemy, with their General and
officers, were prisoners, but released on parol of honor. But over the
joy of triumph for a victory, deep sorrow casts its gloom. We glory
in the issue, while mingling tears of lamentation for the brave Milam,
who nobly fell while fighting in the cause of liberty, and his country.
He was killed by a rifle ball on Tuesday, when the command devolved
upon Col. Francis W. Johnson, the second officer of the detachment, and
who has secured to himself the meed of praise, and the gratitude of his

other brave men fell, and about twenty-five men wounded.</p>

<p>Citizen-Commissioners: with the foregoing intelligence, you will enter
upon the duties of your mission with increased ardor, and brightened
hopes of full success; and while we congratulate you as being the bearers
of such joyful news, we renew to you our farewell blessing, and desire for

upon which it was originated, signed by the President and Secretary, in
behalf of the General Council, be forthwith forwarded to our said com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall, from the same committee, reported two letters to Thomas

safety of Nacogdoches; which were read and adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris, from the committee to dispatch expresses &amp;c., reported
verbally, on the manner in which they had discharged that duty.</p>

<p>The Executive Secretary presented the following message from the
Governor; which was read and ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">
To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council:</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>I herewith transmit the following bills, with my approval and signa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ture:</p>

<p>The one requiring the commander-in-chief to remove his head quarters
to Washington.</p>

<p>One settling the mode by which officers of the army receive their
grade, when difficulties on that account should present themselves.</p>

<p>One appointing a Post Master General, and other officers.</p>

<p>One requesting the commander at Goliad to afford assistance, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One for calling a convention.</p>

<p>And one for creating the municipality of Sabine.</p>

<p>Two I have returned without my signature for the following reasons:</p>

<p>The one requiring of me a transcript of the instructions extended to
our foreign agents and also the correspondence had with General Bur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />leson
and other officers. Those to which you allude are all spread upon
the record in my Secretary’s office, and subject at all times to the perusal
of your body, and inasmuch as I have but one Secretary belonging to my
department, whose duties are arduous, and as such could illy spare the
time to make those transcripts, must beg the favor of your body to send
one of your own clerks for that purpose.</p>

<p>The other is an appropriation bill, in favor of McLaughlin, for the sum
of twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>I have only to say to your body, whatever the facts of the case may

be, I am bound to premise that this bill was sent to my office through
mistake, for it is evident as the law now stands, that this bill or any
other appropriation bill, must originate with the committee on finance,
whose privilege it is to originate appropriations, and check on the Treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ury
for the amount, and have the same entered on the journals of your
body. As such, my office is rid of the trouble of keeping any record per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />taining
to the originating appropriations, or making drafts upon the
Treasury. There seems to be no propriety in sending the bill up to me,
when the authority to act is withdrawn from my department. Therefore
for the sake of consistency, if for no other reason, I return the bill.</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>December 15, 1835.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Parker, the House proceeded to elect judges and
commissioners for organizing the militia in the municipality of Sabine.
The rule of voting by ballot was suspended, and James Gaines was elect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed
first judge, William Harris second judge; and Isaac Lowe, Albert
Hinds and Matthew Parker were elected commissioners.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. ------------, the inland revenue district, created by an
ordinance and decree, imposing duties on imposts, &amp;c., was called Milam
revenue district, and Benjamin Holt appointed collector of the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Powers made a verbal report, that he had waited on General Mexia,
agreeably to a resolution of the Council, that General Mexia declined
co-operating with the volunteer army at Bexar, in consequence of which
he did not think himself authorized' to act under the resolution.</p>

<p>The report was accepted, and on motion of Mr. Harris,
Resolved, that the thanks of this Council be presented to Mr. Powers,
for the prompt and satisfactory manner in which he discharged the duty
required of him by the resolution of this Council.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris offered the following resolution:</p>

<p>Resolved, that the thanks of the General Council be presented to
Thomas Gay for his patriotic exertions in forwarding the plans of this
Government, respecting the volunteer army, &amp;e.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Planks, resolved, that the Governor be required to
notify either Henry Augustin, or Horton of the municipality of San Au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gustine,
that there is a vacancy in the Council from that municipality,
and require the attendance of one of them.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett,</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Secretary be required to- give Mr. Padilla a certi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficate
of his time of service in this Council, that he may draw what is
due him after deducting advances made him.</p>

<p>Mr. Padilla’s account for articles furnished the volunteer army was
oresented and referred to the committee on public accounts.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett,</p>

<p>Ee,solved, that the Treasurer be directed not to pay over to any orders
already drawn, any part of the money returned by Mr. Gay this day, but
hold it subject to any future orders of this Council.</p>

<p>The Executive Secretary presented the following message from the
Governor:</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p>To the Honorable the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council:</p>

<p>Gentlemen:—</p>

<p>I herewith transmit for your information, documents received from
various persons, touching a wrecked vessel near the Port of Matagorda.</p>

<p>That the unfortunate should receive the treatment as indicated in
these communications, is truly to be lamented, and if possible, should be
remedied. If, however, your body should not consider it in their power
to reach the present case, but leave it for the investigation of the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stituted
authorities, it would at least be well to take the precaution to
prevent in some efficient manner, a recurrence of similar conduct. Our
sea coast for years has produced nothing but a scene of fraud, corruption
and piracies, to the unfortunate, who either by misfortune or design have
been driven upon our shores.</p>

<p>So well have we already established our character abroad for having a
piratical coast, that it is with difficulty insurances can be effected, and
always at an unusual high rate, and frequently not at all. This stage if
things has grown entirely out of our disorganized situation, and not hav<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the proper laws enacted to restrain the vice.</p>

<p>I confidently hope, that your honorable body will take this matter into
consideration, and pass such laws as will prevent a recurrence of these
evils, by making it highly criminal, in any person who will embezzle, or
attempt to defraud the unfortunate, by the unlawful seizure or sale of
their property.—They have very appropriately been termed the bone
pickers, who are eagle-eyed, ever hovering around to pounce upon their
unfortunate prey. It is now high time that Texas should retrieve her
character, in that respect, by passing laws for the protection of wrecked
property, whether found immediately at the wreck or elsewhere on the
sea coast, and designating the means by which salvage should be ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />judged
and settled, and that a proper disposition be made of the balance,
for the benefit of whom it may concern.</p>

<p>Having lived since my first settlement in the country contiguous to
the sea coast, and frequently called upon in an official capacity, to extend
protests and other documents, relative to wrecked vessels, I am well
aware of the intrigue, management and downright roguery, which has
been universally practised by the unprincipled speculators, and always
to the great injury, and frequently, total ruin of the unfortunate, without
having it in my power to remedy the evil; which makes me now more

solicitous that your honorable body give the subject that attention which
it justly merits.</p>

<p>I am gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>December 16th, 1835.</p>

<p>The communications accompanying the message were referred as fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lows:</p>

<p>A communication from J. W. Fannin, junior, respecting the disposi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of a vessel wrecked at Matagorda, referred to the committee on the
state and judiciary.</p>

<p>A letter from sundry citizens of Matagorda, requesting the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of an auctioneer, &amp;c., referred to the committee to revise the rev<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />enue

<p>A communication from Judge “Wilson, respecting certain prisoners,
&amp;c., referred to Mr. Barrett.</p>

<p>The President laid before the House a letter from General Houston,
respecting the resignation of Lieutenant “Whitaker. Referred to the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
on military affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson, from Viesca, appeared, was sworn and took his seat,
as a member of the. Council.</p>

<p>The President laid before the House a letter from Mr. Forsyth, respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
ammunition forwarded from Harrisburg; which was referred to the
committee on public accounts.</p>

<p>The account of Mr. Huff, for services rendered to the volunteer army,
was referred to the committee on public accounts.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, made the following
report, accompanied by an ordinance for the creation of a legion of
cavalry; which was read and ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>Your committee are of opinion, that the regular army of Texas, should
be augmented. From the intercepted correspondence forwarded to us
by the commanding officer at Goliad, and the commanding officer before
Bexar, together with all the communications received from the interior,
we are satisfied, that not less than eight or ten thousand central troops,
under the command of Santa Annans bravest and most experienced offi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cers
will be sent to invade Texas, between now and the ensuing spring,
in addition to those already within the borders of our State. From every
indication, Texas will have to battle single handed against the combined
forces of the central party, with Santa Anna for their leader, throughout
Mexico. The central party embraces most of the talents, wealth and
population, of the Mexican confederacy. The power and influence of
the Priest, will “also be extended against us. Church and State are thus
combined for the overthrow and demolition of free institutions; and the
friends and advocates of Constitutional liberty, in the interior, are so
few and weak, that they dare not resist the encroachments and usurpa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
of power, which have been made by this tremendous engine of des<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />potism—the
union of Church and State!—Texas alone has dared to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sist
these usurpations: to vindicate her rights, and to repulse the hireling

<pb n="671" xml:id="P0671" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/679/" />

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

soldiery of the ruffian tyrant, who have polluted our soil with their foot<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />steps;
aiming their blows at the life and liberty of every citizen.</p>

<p>Under this view of our situation, your committee believe that the es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablishment
of a sufficient force to be the only means by which we can
sustain ourselves in the present struggle; and no man, we believe, will
contend for a moment, that the regular army, to be raised in accordance
with the organic law, will be able to resist and repel the combined forces
of all Mexico. What? Protect a sea coast of three hundred and fifty
miles, an extended frontier, and a scattered population of seventy or
eighty thousand inhabitants, with eleven or twelve hundred men, against
the forces of a nation containing eight millions of inhabitants; and that
nation denouncing us as rebels and traitors. Yes! Our frontier is already
invaded by their troops, and all the horrors of war brought within our
country. An augmentation of the army, is therefore absolutely neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary
for our safety and security; for the establishment and permanency
of free institutions in Texas, rest entirely upon the success of our arms.
Your committee are also of opinion, that one of the most important parts
of the army has been overlooked, to wit, the establishment of a troop of
cavalry. A troop of cavalry is indispensable for many reasons. No part
of the army, infantry especially, can move with that celerity to any part
of the country, which may be attacked by the enemy, as a troop of cavalry
is necessary to harrass an advancing or retreating enemy: Also to cut off
the provisions and supplies, and intercept the communications of our
enemies—to carry an express and do any act which requires celerity and
promptness of movement. Your committee has consulted, gentlemen of
experience and known abilities, relative to the creation of a troop of
cavalry. It is the opinion of Col. Fannin that the regular army should be
increased. General Austin, General Houston and W. B. Travis, Esq.,
all concur with your committee in the immediate necessity of creating a
troop of cavalry. It is true, that it will cost several thousand dollars, to
raise, organize, arm and equip an efficient troop of cavalry. Yet no one
can be so blind as to renounce the lasting prosperity and greatness of
Texas, rather than'spend a few thousand dollars, or a million if it were
necessary.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the accompany<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
ordinance.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks also submitted an ordinance, &amp;c. prohibiting officers of the
army from holding any other office during the war; which was read and
laid on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Millard, from the committee on finance, offered the follow reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution,
which was passed:</p>

<p>Resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government of
Texas, that whereas, a United States note or bank bill, with the check

being the same paid into the Treasury of the Provisional Government of

Gay or any other person, for the same amount in cash, or smaller bills
or notes, on the same or any other bank or banks of the United States
or State, in North America, that shall be passing current at this time
in Texas; fully guaranteeing to said Thomas Gay or others, that should
the said note or bill of one thousand dollars, prove to be spurious, and
not payed when presented for payment to the Bank of the United States,
or any of its branches, then said Treasurer of the Government of Texas,,
shall be bound to refund said amount of one thousand dollars to Thomas.
Gay, or whosoever shall have changed the same, out of any monies or
Government funds, belonging to the Government of Texas, that the said
Treasurer may have control of, at that time, or any time thereafter, with

<p>Mr. Barrett from the committee on state and judiciary, to whom was
referred the letter of J. W. Eannin, junior, respecting the disposition of
the wreck at Matagorda, made the following report, accompanied by an
ordinance and decree, for sequestering and securing the cargo of the

same, and for other purposes.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />General Council of the Provisional Government of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the letter of Col. J. W. Fannin,
junior, report,—</p>

<p>That from the character of this gentleman, and his relation to the
Government, with the advantages possessed by him for diffusing correct
information, no doubt can be entertained of the correctness of his in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />telligence.
From the facts stated by Col. Fannin, a high handed and
unlawful course has been pursued by certain individuals, as regards the
disposition of the schooner Hannah Elizabeth, and her cargo, driven on
the beach by the enemies armed vessel Bravo.</p>

<p>This schooner appears to have belonged to the United States of the
North, and freighted by citizens of Texas; the owners taken prisoners
by the Mexican vessel, together with a number of passengers on board
the schooner.</p>

<p>By a course of fortuitous circumstances, she was gotten possession
of by Capt. Hurd, sailing under our flag, and whose vessel is registered i n
Texas, assisted by some citizens of Matagorda, together with eleven pris<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />oners,
without any adjudication, and under the most suspicious circum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stances,
a pretended sale of the cargo and vessel was effected by the cap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tors.</p>

<p>By the organic law of the Provisional Government of Texas, the Presi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dent
and Council are constituted a court of admiralty, having to decide
all cases coming within such jurisdiction.—By the conduct of Capt. Hurd
and his co-adjutors, a disrespect, if not a decided contempt, has been
manifested for the laws and high tribunal of the people, in this matter.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore advise, that one or more commissioners be
appointed by this Council, one of whom to be from this body, and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioned
and instructed by the Governor, forthwith to proceed to Mata<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gorda,
with full power to seize and sequester the schooner so taken, with
all her cargo, wherever to be found, and institute an enquiry; to call be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
them such persons as may be necessary for a full development of
facts; and with powers to arrest and send such persons before the court
of admiralty, as may be culpable or guilty of unlawful acts in the busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness;
and to suspend the commission and registry of the commander,
and of the vessel "William Robbins,” if the facts require it, and report
noth all possible expedition to the Governor and Council of their pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings.</p>

<p>We also advise that the Mexican prisoners taken on board the cap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tured
schooner, be held in safe custody, to answer for the treatment and
exchange of our citizens in the power of the Mexican officers. To this
end your committee advise the adoption of the accompanying ordinance
and decree.</p>

<p>The foregoing report was adopted, and the ordinance read the first
time; when the rule was suspended,-and the ordinance read the second
time.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the blank in the first section was filled in
the first section, with the names of Thomas Barnett, Robert H. Williams
and James Collingsworth.</p>

<p>The rule was further suspended and the ordinance read a third time;

when the question was taken on its final passage, and decided in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>Mr. Power, who had been authorized to aid General Mexia to proceed
to Bexar, made the following report, which was accepted:</p>

<p>I have called on General Mexia at Columbia. He has declined to go
to Bexar to join with our people. His object is to go to Copano to join
with the two hundred Mexicans who are at Palo Blanco; and from thence
to take Matamoras, if possible. Mr. Fisher, who is acting Secretary to
the General, stated to me that the General could not place his military
character at stake by accepting a command under the Provisional Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
of Texas, as Mr. Viesea is not Governor, I further understood
that General Mexia will be here in a short time, with a view of seeing the
Governor and Council, in hopes that they will place armed vessels to
blockade the ports of Vera Cruz and Tampico, and order all vessels
bound for said ports to Matamoras, where they can discharge their cargo,
as there seems to be no doubt of the latter port falling into the hands of
the liberal party. Mr. Fisher further stated that he was bearer of dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />patches
to General Mexia, that in February next there is a general plan
of revolutionizing all over Mexico. Under these circumstances I thought
it most prudent to return and inform the Council, and subject myself to
their further orders on this subject.</p>

<p>JAMES POWER.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerr, from the committee on land and Indian affairs, made the
following report and resolution:</p>

<p>Your committee on land and Indian affairs, beg leave to report, that
the third session of the organic law7, makes it the duty of the Governor
and his Council, to treat with the several tribes of Indians within the
limits of Texas, concerning their claims to land, and if possible to secure
their friendship.</p>

<p>By reference to the proceedings of the General Convention, it will be
seen that they made a solemn decree, that the Cherokee Indians and their
associate bands, (twelve tribes in number, agreeably to their last General
Council in Texas,) have derived their just claims to lands, included
within the bounds, hereafter mentioned, from the Government of Mex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ico;
from which also we have derived our rights to the soil by grant and
occupancy.</p>

<p>The General Convention also solemnly decreed, that the Governor and
Council, shall immediately on its organization, appoint commissioners to
treat with the said Indians, to establish the definite boundaries of their
territory, and secure their confidence and friendship. For the purpose
of carrying into effect the aforesaid third section of the organic law, and
the solemn declarations of the General Convention.</p>

<p>Your committee beg leave to offer for your consideration and action,
the accompanying resolution,</p>

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government
of Texas, that Sam Houston, John Forbes and John Cameron, be and
they are hereby appointed commissioners, to treat with the Cherokee
Indians, and their twelve associate bands, under such instructions as may
be given them by the Governor and Council; and should it so happen,
that all the commissioners cannot attend, any two of them shall have
power to conclude a treaty, and report the same to the General Council
of the Provisional Government, for its approval and ratification.</p>

<pb n="675" xml:id="P0675" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/683/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="122" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>Resolved, that said commissioners be required to hold said treaty as
soon as practicable.</p>

<p>The foregoing report was adopted, and the resolutions ordered to lie
on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Clements from the select committee to inquire why the proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings
of the Convention and Council have not been published, made the
following report; which was accepted, and a copy ordered to be sent to
the printer.</p>

<p>Your committee, whose duty it was made by a resolution of the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Council, to inquire into the cause why the proceedings of the Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention
and General Council, have not been published before this time,
beg leave to report, that a note has been addressed to the committee who
was appointed by the Convention, the day previous to its close, to superin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tend
the proceedings of said Convention, in pamphlet form, and have
received an answer from two of that committee, James W. Robinson and
D. C. Barrett, both of whom state, that owing to the laborious duties
which devolved upon them as members of the General Council, which
commenced its session immediately after the adjournment of the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention,
they were not able to give their personal attention to the sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject.
It was therefore committed to Mr. Fisher to prepare under the
direction of Mr. Wharton. When prepared, on examination were found
to be imperfect. ' We then revised them and sent them to the printer.
This was done some fifteen or sixteen days since; so it seems from the
statement of the previous committee appointed to superintend the print<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing,
&amp;c., that the proceedings of the convention were not handed to the
printer until the first day of December last, past.
Your committee also addressed a note to the Governor, Henry Smith,
making the same inquiry as was made by the committee appointed by
the Convention, to superintend the printing, &amp;c.; but have received no
answer.</p>

<p>Your committee addressed a note to the printers on the subject, asking
them for their reasons, why the proc.eedings of the Convention had not
been published, anterior to this time; and what progress has been made
in printing the same? Your committee takes much pleasure in stating
that an answer has been received from the printers, assigning reasons
full and satisfactory in the opinion of your committee, why the afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said
proceedings have not been sooner printed.</p>

<p>In addition to the important communication received from the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mander-in-chief
of the volunteer army of the people, before Bexar, and
the intercepted correspondence of the centralists, which require imme<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diate
publication: A circular inviting the people to repair to the seat
of war, and blank commissions for judicial affairs; have also been print<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed.
So that from the press of business by the members of the General
Council, which has been urged upon the printers from time to time, it
has been entirely out of their-power to progress more rapidly with the
printing of the proceedings of the Convention and General Council, than
has already been done. They, the printers, also state that sixteen pages
of the pamphlet have been printed, and considerably more is in type;
and that the rest could be completed in a few days, if no more jobs wer
ordered by the Government in that time,, provided they had paper; but
the stock of paper which they had on hand has been exhausted in print<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
for the Government, as before mentioned, and they are compelled to

<pb n="676" xml:id="P0676" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/684/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="128" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

wait for a supply of paper, which they are daily expecting, before they
can complete the printing of the said proceedings.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding it is highly important for the people to know what
their Representatives in the Convention and General Council have done
and are doing, yet your committee, from what information they have
been able to obtain relative to the printing of the laws, &amp;c., cannot
attach any blame or negligence, whatever, to the printers; but on the
contrary, it is the opinion of your committee that they have discharged
their duty faithfully, so far as it has been in their power.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett made the following report on the letter of Judge Wilson,
which was accepted.</p>

<p>Your special committee of one, to whom was referred the letter of
the Hon. C..Wilson, first judge of the municipality of Matagorda, doth
most conscientiously report:</p>

<p>That the brevity, inconclusiveness and incoherency of Judge Wilson’s
letter, prevents him from forming any conclusions, other, than that some
of the persons elected as officers in. the army of Texas have safer and
more profitable business than fighting; a measure which is so prudent in
itself as to require no comment. And also, that a wreck has taken place,
which has created great displeasure. But what has been wrecked, or
who are so greatly displeased by reason thereof, the Judge has not stated,
and probably because he had not been able to learn the circumstances.</p>

<p>Your committee also advise this house, that Judge Wilson has appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed
a prosecuting attorney, which he had no legal right to do; and that
there are eleven prisoners and one lieutenant, which he has quartered
among the citizens from motives of economy, and concerning which the
Judge asked to be advised. But as your committee is ignorant to what
class of animals the eleven prisoners belong, whether biped or quadruped,
cannot advise this body the nature of the counsel, which would aid the
Judge in his present quandary.</p>

<p>D. C. BARRETT, Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, by leave submitted an ordinance and decree, relating to
the disposition of lands in Texas; which was read and ordered to lie on
the table.</p>

<p>Mr. Mitchell offered the following resolution, which was referred to
the committee on military affairs.</p>

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council of Texas, that a special ranging
company of ten men be raised, to range on the head waters of Cum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ming’s
and Rabb’s creeks, to be commanded by a first and second lieu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tenant,
their service to be discretional with the officers; and that said
officers be instructed to range no longer than they conceive it necessary
for the protection of the citizens, in the immediate vicinity:—And that
said company be entitled to pay agreably to the organic law, for the
time that they serve.</p>

<p>Mr. Steel, commissioner for the Nashville colony, appeared and said
that he was ready to answer any charges against him.</p>

<p>The Council agreed this afternoon to go into an investigation, and ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed
Messrs. Barrett, Milliard and Kerr to conduct the investigation
on the part of the Council.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the Council went into secret session, and

<p>The Executive Secretary presented, approved by the Governor, a reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution
appointing Thomas F. McKinny agent, &amp;e.</p>

<p>The President laid before the House the resignation of Mr. Westover,
as a member of this Council; which was accepted.</p>

<p>The President laid before the House a report from Colonel Pettus,
respecting his operation in aid of General Mexia, and also his resigna<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the office of contractor for the volunteer army.</p>

<p>The resignation was accepted, and the report referred to a select com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee,
consisting of Messrs. Barrett, Clements, McMullen, Powers and
Royall.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the committee appointed on the part of the Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil,
to conduct the investigation in the case of Wm. H. Steel, made a
statement of the proceedings in relation to the refusal of Mr. Steel to
deliver the archives of the Land Office under his charge, together with
the circumstances attending the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Steel came before the Council and stated, that the warrant to
arrest him had not been served upon him, but hearing that one had been
issued, he appeared for the purpose of explaining the circumstances of
his refusal.</p>

<p>He stated that the citizens of Viesca did not consider that their dele<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gates
were clothed with conventional powers, but that they generally
approved of the doings of the Convention, so far as they were informed of
them; that he lived at a great distance from the seat of Government,
from which communications were very uncertain. That as he had been
informed of the provisions of the organic law,. no such powers were
given as claimed by the commissioners, one of whom was a commissioner
for issuing titles under Austin and Williams, who claimed to be em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />presarios
of that colony. That the refusal was made through misunder<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />standing,
and in the moment of excitement, and not from any disrespect
to the Government or its authorities. With this explanation he sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted
himself to the Council.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall,</p>

<p>Resolved, that this council is satisfied from the explanation made by
Mr. Steel, that his refusal to deliver up the archives of the land office
under his charge, was made under a misunderstanding, and not from any
disrespect to the Government or its authorities.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett,</p>

<p>Resolved, that Mr. Steel be furnished with a copy of the above reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lution,
and that he be honorably discharged.</p>

receiving the non-acceptance of Madison Whitaker, as second lieutenant
of infantry; which was accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Clements from the military committee, made the following re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port,
which was adopted:</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom Captain Allen was referred for the purpose
of obtaining information relative to the regular army, and the auxiliary
corps, take pleasure in stating, that the organic law, and the ordinances
were handed to Captain Allen, and that he is anxious to join the regular
army, after examining the same.</p>

<p>Your committee recommend, that the services of Captain Allen be
accepted, and that he has already the requisite number of men for a com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pany,
that we proceed to appoint him Captain in the infantry. A va<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cancy
which has already occurred by the refusal of one of those who was
elected.</p>

<p>Your committee further recommends, that the recommendation of
Captain Allen to F. W. Thornton, for first lieutenant, and McCloskey
and Brush, for second lieutenants, be received, and that their names
stand on the list to fill the first vacancies that take place by resignation
or otherwise</p>

of Ezekiel Williams.</p>

elected second lieutenant of infantry in the regular army, to supply the
vacancy occasioned by the non-acceptance of Madison Whitaker.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Clements, the account of P. Martin, now in the

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council:
</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>I herewith transmit to your body, a communication received from the
commander-in-chief of the army, in which he complains of delays on your

<pb n="680" xml:id="P0680" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/688/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="132" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

part, in making the necessary appropriations for the recruiting service.
It must be obvious to all, that everything connected with the speedy or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganization
of the army, should be attended to as speedily as possible, and
that no obstacle should be thrown in the way in the least calculated to
retard that object which is so essentially necessary to the protection of
the country. I therefore confidently hope that your body will immedi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ately
consider the matter and make such appropriations as will be ample
and sufficient for that service, and place it under such restrictions and se<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curities,
as will be calculated in all cases, to secure the Government from
fraud and imposition, and by no means permit any barrier to remain, in
the least calculated to retard or discourage the recruiting service, on
which so much depends. I further have to suggest to you, the propriety
of appointing the commissioners on the part of the Government, to carry
into effect the Indian treaty as contemplated by the Convention; I can
see no difficulty which can reasonably' occur in the appointment, or select<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the proper agents on our part, having so many examples and prece<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dents
before us. The United States have universally sent their most dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinguished
military officers to perform such duties, because the Indians
generally look up to, and respect their authority as coercive and para<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mount;
I would therefore suggest the propriety of authorizing General
Sam Houston of the- army, and Colonel John Eorbes of Nacogdoches,
who has already been commissioned as one of my aids. These commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioners
would go especially instructed, so that no wrong could be com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted
either to the Government, the Indians, or our individual citizens.
All legitimate rights would be respected and no others; I am well aware
that we have no right to transcend the superior order and declaration
made by the Convention; that we must keep strictly within the provisions
of that article; and if I recollect that article right, the outline, or external
boundaries were demarked, within which the Indian tribes alluded to
should be located; but at the same time paying due regard to the legiti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mate
locations of our own citizens, within the same limits. If these In<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dians
have introduced themselves in good faith under the colonization
laws of the Government, they’ should be entitled to the benefits of those
laws, and comply with their conditions. I deem it a duty which we owe
to them to pay all due respect to their rights, and claim their co-operation
in support of them; and at the same time not infringe the rights of our
own countrymen so far as they have been justly founded. These agents
going under proper instructions would be enabled to do right, but not
permitted to do wrong, as their negotiation would be subject to investi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gation
and ratification by the Government before it would become a law.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and

<p>Gentlemen:—</p>

<p>I herewith transmit to your body two appointments which purport to
have been made by the commander-in-chief of the volunteer army at
Bexar. I lay them before by special request, well knowing that you
understand your duties in that particular, and as such, will appreciate
those appointments in a proper manner. The campaign against Bexar
seems to have terminated by capitulation. It is now time for the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
to bring every thing under its own proper control, and pursue the
organic system in place of confusion, or desultory warfare. This alone
can cure evils, which necessitous precipitancy has thrown in upon us.
That this newly framed organization, springing from the midst of an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />archy
and confusion would be sustained without encountering difficul<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties
could not be expected. Restless, disorganizing spirits are, and ever
have been, busy both in the camp and at home, with their vile intrigues
and machinations to sap the very foundation of all our hopes. Your
honorable body cannot be so blind as not to discover their base pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poses.
I now warn you, to place on them the mark of Cain, as an as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />surance,
that their merited fate awaits them. I have previously admon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ished

determined stand on your part was necessary to the preservation of the
country. The foundation already laid must be sustained, and the fabric
reared upon it; it is for you then, who have been entrusted with the
charge, to aid by your indefatigable perseverance to complete the build<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing.
There is virtue in the people, and they will sustain you.</p>

<p>I am, gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>December 18, 1835.</p>

<p>Mr. Linn, from the select committee appointed to revise the revenue
laws, &amp;c., made the following report, accompanied by a revised ordinance:</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the custom house and revenue
laws, beg leave to make the following report:</p>

<p>That the ordinance and decree establishing ports of entry, and duties
of impost and tonnage, and for other purposes, should be revised for the
following reasons, viz.</p>

<p>1.	The bonds and security to be given by collectors are less than would
cover the amount of public money that might come in their hands.</p>

<p>2.	In the appointing under officers in the custom houses, both the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor
and Council, and collectors had the same authority to make those
officers, anad the result might be, that two officers might be appointed to
the same office, and both appointments be legally made.</p>

<p>3.	In the mode the duties were to have been paid, the payment of
duties on all sums less than one hundred dollars, cash, and all sums over
that amount six months credit; the result would be, that for the first six
months no money could be available to the Government from this branch
of the revenue, and it would be rather unfair to give an importation of
one hundred dollars as much credit as one of five thousand.</p>

<p>4. And also no salaries for the under custom house officers were speci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied,
nor were the entry or clearance fees of vessels defined.</p>

<p>They beg leave to submit to your consideration a revised ordinance
and decree on imposts and tonnage duties, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>JOHN J. LINN, Chairman.</p>

<p>The above report was accepted, and the ordinance read the first time.</p>

<p>An ordinance and decree making an appropriation for the regular
army, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>The Executive Secretary presented approved by the Governor:</p>

<p>An ordinance and decree creating the office of Commissary General,
and regulating the offices of Paymaster and Quarter-master General.</p>

<p>An ordinance and decree making an appropriation for the regular
army, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on miltary affairs, made the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
report, which was adopted:</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the message of his Excellency,
the Governor, of the eighteenth instant, have had the same under con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration,
and respectfully report, that the necessity of system and or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganization,
in the place of confusion and anarchy, are urged in said
message, as all important in the present posture of our affairs.</p>

<p>It is also the opinion of your committee, that the appointment of a
Paymaster for the troops at San Antonio de Bexar, is unnecessary at this
time for several reasons.</p>

<p>In the first place,- there is no money in the Treasury to pay the sol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diers,
or for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Secondly—a Paymaster has been already appointed, and will proceed
to discharge the duties of his office as soon as the Government has funds.
Beside the principal complaint against the General Council is, that two
many offices have been created, and to create that number when there
is nothing for them to do, the present impoverished state of our finances,
would give just cause of complaint.</p>

<p>Your committee cannot under these circumstances recommend the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment
of any additional officer at this time; but as soon as money
can be obtained to pay the troops at Bexar, it will be necessary to appoint
a Paymaster.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Hanks, Mr. Adams had leave to withdraw his
papers.</p>

<p>Mr. Parker, from the committee appointed to examine into the situa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government

<head>COUNCIL Hall, SAN FELIPE de AUSTIN,
<lb />December 23d, 1835.
<lb />nine o’clock, a. M.
</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceedings being read,</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from a select committee, made the following report,
which was adopted:</p>

<p>Your select committee to whom was referred the letters of General
Mexia and others,</p>

<p>Report, that on examing all the papers and documents concerning the
plans of co-operating with, and proposals of assistance to the people of
Texas, from General Mexia and others, Mexican Liberals.</p>

<p>They would advise that the order from the General Council to Thomas
F. McKinney, of the seventeenth instant, be countermanded, as your
committee can find no reason for declining the aid of General Mexia, or
the aid and co-operation of any Mexican Liberal, whose cause is our
cause, as opposed to military despotism: and advise that the advances
made to General Mexia by the Government agents, be respected.—But
your committee are under the necessity of recommending to this Council,
the avoidance of future responsibilities and advances, on account of our
Mexican fellow-citizens, whose interests are directing their efforts against
centralism, in common with ourselves.</p>

<p>Our Treasury is barren, our resources for present operations must be
drawn from foreign capitalists, and of consequence, doubtful. And if
the Mexican patriots are induced to act in the common cause, let them
depend upon their own resources, as Texas does upon hers. Texas asks
no pecuniary aid at the hands of her Mexican brethren; nor is she able
to extend it to them. Her citizens will resist the oppression and violation
of their rights at every hazard, with or without the assistance of any
power on earth; resting confidently that the justice of their cause will
secure the sanction of the omnipotent God; who will protect them in
their noble efforts to sustain the natural rights of man.</p>

<p>D. C. BARRETT, Chairman
<lb />of the select committee of five.</p>

<p>December 23d, 1835.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the President of the Council be requested to address
a letter to Mr. McKinney on the subject of the foregoing report, and that
he enclose therein a copy of this report and resolution.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. West, the House proceeded to the election of first

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The Executive Secretary presented the following message from the
Governor, which together with the accompanying documents, was re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
to the committee on military affairs:</p>

<head>Executive Department of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the President and members
<lb />of the General Council.</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>I herewith transmit to you various documents received from the som<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mander
at Bexar.</p>

<p>You will see various bills which they think necessary to be filled out,
all of which you will compare and consider. The bills already forwarded
to the United States to be filled by special agents, you will take into
sideration, and see if any thing additional should be ordered.</p>

<p>Of the article of bread stuff, they seem to be very scarce, and from ver<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bal
bal information, very little is on the way from Gonzales. What orders
have been sent to commissaries, for the forwarding of supplies from the
West, by way of Labacca, I am not advised, but hope that the necessary
means will be used to keep them supplied, with whatever the garrison
may need.</p>

<p>You will also see an account in favor of Mr. Arnold, of which you
will make the proper disposition.</p>

<p>The documents relating to the creation of officers in the camp, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quiring
commissions, &amp;c. &amp;c., I have passed over to General Houston,
the commander-in-chief, with a request that he proceed to order the
proper officers to that point to takq command, and reduce the previous
disorganization to system.</p>

<p>I also transmit to you, documents this moment received from Capt.
Caldwell of Gonzales, who has been engaged in forwarding supplies to.
the army.</p>

<p>I have also received verbal information, that Capt. Caldwell has un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fortunately
received a wound which will probably retard the prosecution
of his duties for the present. By verbal request of officers, who have
been in command at -Bexar, I am informed that a Mr. Smith, a deaf
man, well known to the army for his vigilence and meritorious acts, has
been severely wounded in storming Bexar, and that his family are daily
expected in this place, with an expectation that the Council would ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ercise
such guardianship over them as their situation may require. Thein
head remains in camp, as his services as a spy cannot well be dispensed
with. All of which is transmitted to your honorable body for its informa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
and corresponding effects, by your</p>

<p>Obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, made the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
report, which was read and ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>The committee on military affairs to whom was referred major P. W.
Johnson’s letter of the eighteenth of December, 1835,'from head Quar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ters
at San Antonio de Bexar, have had the same under consideration,
and from the information contained therein, together with the intelli<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gence
received of the movements of general Cos, after his departure from
San Antonio de Bexar, from a private source, renders it necessary to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />centrate
on the frontier, at the most important points, all the troops that
can be raised, and that as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>We are also informed by the communication received from Bexar, that
advices have been received at that place, stating that general Reuvier
Sesma, had arrived at Loredo with five hundred cavalry, and one thou<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sand
infantry for the purpose of reinforcing general Cos; and that an
army was raising at San Louis Potosi to be commanded by President
Santa Anna.</p>

<p>Your committee would therefore recommend, that an express be sent
to the commander-in-chief of the regular army of Texas, forwarding to
him a copy of the letter received from Bexar of the eighteenth ultimo;
and the private intelligence of the movements of general Cos, and fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ther;
that Colonel J. W. Pannin be ordered to proceed, forthwith, to the
west, and take command of the regular and auxiliary troops, and that Col.
Travis be ordered to repair, with all possible dispatch, to the frontier or

<pb n="695" xml:id="P0695" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/703/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="147" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

the seat of war, with all the troops he can bring into the field at this
time, under his command; and that the troops at Washington, and such
as may be on the Gaudaloupe, will be ordered to repair immediately, to
Goliad, Copano, or Bexar, for the purpose of co-operating with, and act<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
in concert in the general defensive or offensive operations, which may
be ordered or deemed necessary.</p>

<p>Your committee would further earnestly recommend, that the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mander-in-chief,
be ordered to concentrate all the troops under his
command, or that can be brought into the field, at Goliad, or Copano,
with all possible dispatch, taking care at the same time, to procure by
his contractors, the necessary supplies of provisions for the sustenance of
his troops, and that his orders be executed with all promptness and dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />patch.
And further that the commander-in-chief be required to arrange,
and give orders to his recruiting officers, and make such disposition of
his recruiting officers as may be deemed best by him.</p>

<p>Therefore your committee recommend the adoption of the following
resolutions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch,, as the number of troops fit for duty now in the field is very
much augmented: there being four hundred troops now at Bexar, seventy
at Washington,' eighty at Goliad, two hundred at Velasco, and several
companies on their march to the different military posts and places of
rendezvous; making in the aggregate seven hundred and fifty men, now
in service, and ready for active operation; and at least one hundred more,
not enumerated in the above aggregate who will join the army in a few
days. Active operations should be immediately commenced. For the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pense
of the above number of men, now in service, together with the
officers and contingent expenses, are too great for Texas, in the present
state of her finances. Besides to keep the troops idle, who have entered
the service, will do us great injury at this time. It will induce those who
are willing to aid us, to believe that we have no use for any more troops;
and it will give our enemies time to fortify Matamoras and Loredo; so
they can demonstrate upon us in the spring or whenever they think
proper; knowing that their fortifications would enable them to retreat
securely, even if they were defeated, and should it become necessary to
take either of the aforesaid places, for the security of our frontier, it will
■ be far more difficult, than it would be at this time. And no man can doubt
the importance and necessity of striking a decisive blow, at once, by
taking Matamoras, we have the possession'of the key! yes, the commercial
depot of the whole country north and northwest, for several hundred
miles. We can then fortify the place; demonstrate, when an occasion
presents itself, or it becomes necessary, upon the towns north and west.
We can also land provisions, and all the munitions of war, and troops if
necessary at that point (Matamoras) at any time with perfect safety, and
without, incurring half the expense or risk we must at present. And we
can also command the Gulf of Mexico from that point to the city of
New Orleans, and land our troops and supplies wherever we please.</p>

<p>Therefore be it resolved, by the General Council of the Provisional
Government of Texas: That his Excellency Henry Smith, Governor, be
and he is hereby earnestly requested to concentrate all his troops, by his
proper officers, at Copano and San Patricio for the purpose of carrying
into effect the objects expressed and contained in the foregoing report.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved, that no officer of the regular army of Texas

<pb n="696" xml:id="P0696" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/704/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="148" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

shall receive pay until he is in actual service, under orders of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mander-in-chief.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks from the same committee presented the following report,
which was read and adopted.</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the petition of certain officers
asking permission to proceed to Copano, have had the same under consid<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eration,
and would respectfully recommend to the honorable the General
Council that his excellency the Governor be requested to give said peti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioners
permission or orders to proceed to Copano to fortify and defend
said place, until they receive further orders, and that his excellency,
Henry Smith, Governor, be requested to notify the commander-in-chief
of the regular army of Texas of the same.</p>

<p>Your committee deems it important to order Capt. Allen to that point,
and also to accept the service of such volunteers as tender their services,
to aid Captain Allen and his company for many important reasons. In
the first place, provisions ammunition, and supplies will be ordered to
Copano by our agents in New Orleans, and they will be liable to be taken
by our enemies, unless a sufficient force is stationed there to guard them.
Besides, we are threatened with a large army under the command of
Santa Anna: and by building fortifications at different points on the
frontier of our state we shall be able to contend against a much superior
force to what we otherwise should. It will also throw an additional num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber
of troops on the frontier to co-operate and act in concert with the
regular and auxiliary troops, should a large force be sent to invade us
immediately: which we have every reason to believe will be the case, and
that before we can even raise and organize a regiment of the regular army.</p>

<p>Your committee would therefore respectfully recommend the hon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />orable,
the General Council, the adoption of the following resolution.</p>

<p>Resolved, That Captain Allen’s and J. Cheneweth’s petition together
with this report be copied by the secretary and handed to his excellency
Henry Smith, Governor of the Provisional Government of Texas.</p>

<p>The president submitted several communications from Nacogdoches
and other places, which were 'read and referred to the committee on the
state and judiciary.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall, the vote ordering the ordinance and decree
for creating the office of Auditor, to lie on the table was reconsidered and
the ordinance recommitted with instructions to amend it by creating the
office of comptroller.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall presented the account of John W. Allen, which was
allowed, and the chairman of the committee of Finance directed to draw
on the treasurer in favor of said Allen, for two hundred and twenty five
dollars.</p>

<p>The House took up the message of the Governor of the seventeenth
instant, containing charges, &amp;c., which had been laid on the table on the
twenty-third.</p>

<p>When the resolutions offered by Mr. Menifee were amended, and passed
unanimously in the following form:</p>

<p>1st. Resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government
of Texas, That this Council does not recognize or acknowledge any power
in the executive branch of said Government, to object to, or veto appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments

consequent upon his office; and even it otherwise, the veto as re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turned
upon the list of officers appointed by this Council, dated the

the ordinance and decree declaring the mode of passing, signing and pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lishing
the ordinances, decrees and resolutions of the Provisional Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
of Texas. The list of officers appointed was sent to the executive
office the twelfth of December, and returned December seventeenth.</p>

<p>3d. Resolved, that by the eleventh article of the organic law, this
Council can only consider charges and specifications preferred against a

<p>The Executive Secretary presented a message from the Governor, which

<p>The following is the message:</p>

<head>Executive Department of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Legislative Council:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen:—</p>

<p>I transmit to your body a transcript made from a communication just
received from John Forbes, Esq. of Nacogdoches, a part of the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munication
being of a private character, precludes its introduction, ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cept
such part as relates to the public.</p>

<p>Mr. Forbes encloses back a commission, which had been previously
sent to him, which I herewith transmit to you with these remarks, as a
reason why it was returned. That he had previously received the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment
of first judge of that municipality, and in obedience to an
ordinance and decree regulating offices under this Government, he felt
bound to decline his acceptance to the last commission, and as such re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turned

<pb n="701" xml:id="P0701" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/709/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="153" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

it with these remarks. And furthermore says, “that owing to the
combined and active opposition of some six or eight speculators, sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tained
by individuals from the States, who employ them to engross the
lands that are properly the public domain, that the intentions of the
Government and its acts relating to the public lands, and even its judi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cial
acts, have been delayed and interrupted, greatly to the injury of the
public.”</p>

<p>He further says, “I should be happy to receive from the Council some
rules for my government as judge; the duties of which I shall endeavor
faithfully to discharge.”</p>

<p>He says further, “I am solicitous to learn whether the two per cent.,
duties, which have heretofore been laid for the use of the State, is yet in
force.” And concludes by saying, “a good set of uniform laws or de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />crees,
regulating and governing the judiciary, would have a beneficial in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fluence,
&amp;c.”</p>

<p>Your honorable body will plainly see from the foregoing, the situation
of the land offices to the East, and that the acts of the Convention have
not been carried into effect: nor does it appear that they can be, short of
a military force, and whether such a course would be calculated to pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />duce
any salutary effect, is for your honorable body to determine. That
some kind of effort should be made by us to sustain and protect the pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic
interest, must be obvious to all. While we are contending with a
powerful foe, even for our very existence, that we should find men
among us capable of committing piracies both on sea and land, is, I must
admit, rather discouraging; but permit me to say to you, that every oppo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sition
has a powerful tendency to stimulate me to a greater exertion, and
I hope it will have the same effect on your honorable body.—Opposition,
strong, vigilant and persevering was by me anticipated, hence I am never
taken by surprise, or deceived in the persons who stir up. They never'
considered the public good, but seek- their own private interests; hence
they are ever vigilant and on the wing. It is made our duty to guard
and protect that which they wish to destroy. They dread organization
as a great evil, because honest investigation follows as a matter of course,
which they dread; prefering darkness to light, because their deeds have'
been evil.</p>

<p>These men have their unprincipled hirelings and satelites to operate,
and endeavor to keep themselves' behind the screen; they may not be
generally known to your body, and as such, will no doubt, often attempt
to practice fraud upon you, by their insinuating approaches. Me, they
seldom approach: they may overpower, but never can deceive.
I consider that we are discharging the public trust confided to us by the
representatives of the people, and that our duties should be performed
with that energy and promptitude which the true interests of the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try
and the expectations of the people require at our hands; regardless
of all other considerations, I would recommend to the consideration of
your honorable body, the propriety of some efficient force to be adopted,
to carry into effect the decrees of the late Convention, and also the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />crees
of the Provisional Government, predicated on their authority. Let
us honestly and faithfully discharge our duties, and the people will sus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain
us.</p>

<p>I am entirely at a loss to know what is meant in the inquiry of Mr.
Forbes respecting the two per cent, duty, heretofore collected in favor of

<pb n="702" xml:id="P0702" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/710/" />

the Government, and whether it is still continued, &amp;c. I have never
known any such duty, or law having been in force.</p>

<p>I am gentlemen,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the letter of B. B. Goodrich,
have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to report, that it
is impossible to enlist men in the service, or obtain aid, unless provisions
are furnished to them, for very few of them have the means of sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sistence;
and we cannot expect aid, either at home or abroad, unless some
provision is made for their reception and subsistence, and we have satis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />factory
information, that persons are now at Washington, and daily ar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />riving,
who have come with the avowed object of assisting Texas in her'
present struggle, and we have declared to them through our agents, as
well as otherwise, and to our friends throughout the United States of
the North, that ample provision shall be and is made for them, and
inasmuch as there is no money in the Treasury at present, and to coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />teract
the evil that must grow out of the present state of things; your
committee recommend the adoption of the following resolutions:</p>

<p>Be it resolved, that the contractor of the Provisional Government of
Texas, at the town of Washington, be and he is hereby authorized, to
press provisions for the men going to the army, or such as intend joining
the army: Provided, they cannot be purchased; and to give drafts upon
the Government aforesaid for the same; and that said debts be consid<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ered
as cash due by the Government; and that said Contractor be, and
he is hereby authorized to call upon the civil authorities to assist him to
obtain said provisions, if necessary.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved, that the Secretary furnish a certified copy of
this report and resolutions, and forward the same to the Contractor at
Washington, on the Brasos.</p>

<p>The ordinance and decree creating the municipality of Fort Bend, was
taken up and read the second time; when, on motion of Mr. Harris, it
was laid on the table until to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Linn, from the committee on enrollments, reported as duly en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rolled,</p>

<p>"An ordinance defining and fixing the boundaries of the municipality
of Matagorda.”</p>

<p>Also, "a resolution respecting an exchange of Mexican prisoners.”</p>

<p>On motion, the House adjourned till to-morrow, nine o’clock, a. m.</p>

<head>Council Hall, San Felipe de Austin,
<lb />December 28th, 1835.
<lb />NINE O’CLOCK, A. M.</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceeding being read,</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, made the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
report; which was read and adopted:</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred Mr. Arnold’s account, beg leave
to report, that it has not the necessary proof or vouchers, accompanying
it, consequently your committee cannot act upon it, but ask permission
to return said account to the House for their action, and for your com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
to be hence discharged.</p>

<p>The report being approved, the committee were accordingly discharged.</p>

<p>The committee, to whom was referred the letter of Thomas J. Rusk,
together with the instructions given by the General Council to Colonel
Rusk, to hurry out troops to Bexar, &amp;c., have had the same under con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration
and beg leave to report, that the President of the General
Council be requested to notify Colonel Rusk to desist from enlisting
troops, only for the regular army and auxiliary corps, and to report the
same to the commander-in-chief of the army of Texas.</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the letter of William Bromly,
have had the same under consideration, and respectfully report, that Mr.
William Bromly's name be placed upon the list of applicants for a situa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
in the engineer department.</p>

<p>Your committee having examined the letter of recommendation of
Mr. Edward B. Wood, would respectfully recommend that his name be
placed upon the list of applicants for an office, suitable to his abilities
and qualifications, as soon as a vacancy takes place.</p>

<p>Your committee thinks it due to Mr. Wood, as he comes to our coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try
highly recommended, believing it very important to encourage the
emigration of young men of education and respectability to our country.
For upon such men will ere long devolve the task of legislation and all
the arduous duties of Government.</p>

<p>The same committee also reported that they had addressed a letter to
Mr. Bell, in pursuance of an order of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks from the same committee returned to the House a list of
the wounded at the storming of Bexar, which was ordered to be placed
on file.</p>

<p>The President submitted a letter from E. Hall, agent at New Orleans,
which was read and referred to the committee on the state and judiciary.</p>

<p>The President also submitted a communication from S. Rhodes Fisher,
respecting the schooner Hannah Elizabeth, which was read and referred
to a select committee, consisting of Messrs. Barrett, Royall and Kerr,
with power to send for persons and papers.</p>

<p>The following accounts were presented and allowed, and the chairman
of the committee of finance, directed to draw orders on the treasurer in
favor of the several individuals, for their respective amounts, viz.:</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett from the .committee on the state and judiciary, made the
following report, which was read and ordered to lie on the table:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the General-Council
<lb />of the Provisional Government:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on state and Judiciary to whom was referred the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor’s
message of the 36th instant, and various letters and documents
from Nacogdoches—</p>

<p>Respectfully report, that from the general information contained in
the Governor’s message and letters from S. H. Everitt, Esq. the only
acting commissioner under the fourteenth section of the organic law, in
the department of Nacogdoches, and the other documents referred; your
committee are unwillingly convinced of the prevalence of a spirit of dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />organization,
in some parts of that country, which in a more limited de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gree,
also, exists elsewhere in Texas; and that this spirit, the natural con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sequence
of the revolutionary state of our country, a change in its form
of government, a mixed population, coming from various parts of the
world, strangers to each other and unassimilated in character or habit;
but your committee are well convinced, from the knowledge of the Anglo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />American
character which constitutes the greater part of Texas citizens,
that the intelligence and moral feeling of the mass of that people, ever
reflective, would have ere this led them to consistency of conduct, and
respect for the existing authorities, created by their own representatives,
from the present necessity, however crude in organization, yet giving
order and affording protection for the time; were it not for ambitious
demagogues, designing and sinister speculators, equally destitute of patri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />otism,
and regardless of the people’s rights, and every other considera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
that obstructs the gratification of their own private ends. Such men,
even in a settled and well regulated community, often distract the minds
of the honest and undesigning, disturb the harmony of society, until by
a severe rebuke from the people themselves, or by the strong arm of the
law, their career of wickedness is checked, and they become objects of
contempt and infamy. That the good people are troubled from such men
among them, is by no means unexpected. To guard against the conse<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quences
of their evil machinations is our first duty, and involving im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mense
responsibility upon all the officers of the Provisional Government;
and we cannot hope to effect this, unless union, prudence, justice and
firmness, are the governing motives of all our conduct throughout all
our councils.</p>

<p>Your committee most cordially respond to the principles of action
recommended to this Council, as necessary to the very existence of order
and respect for the laws, and are fully aware of the magnitude of the
evil and deep injury to the country, consequent upon the intrigues,
frauds and uncontrolled ravages of the daring and unprincipled land
speculators, who infest the country, agitating the public mind with base
falsehoods, and keeping up discord, distrust and disrepute to their own
and only source of present protection, and last barrier against anarchy
and internal war, the Provisional Government of Texas. Your commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee
confidently assure his excellency that the General Council know these

<pb ed="unknown" n="160" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

men too well to be deceived by them; and while acting under the influ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence
of principles hitherto governing the conduct of this body, feel that
the virtue and intelligence of a free people will sustain their acts. Con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fiding
in the certain effect of such motives as tending to the objects of
our existence, when strengthened with the unanimity and concert of
the co-ordinate branch of this Government, your committee would re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spectfully
call the attention of the Provisional Government to the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
views:</p>

<p>1st. To the situation of the commissioner, S. H. Everitt, Esq., who,
standing alone with a high sense of duty to his country, has subjected
himself to the malice of wicked men, whose ill-nature he contemns, and
whose threats he defies. But in this situation, although ably sustained by
many high minded patriots, he has been unable to accomplish the work
entrusted to him by the representatives of the people. Other causes
than resistance have prevented. The non-acceptance of the other com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioners
appointed; the scruples of Judge Forbes (appointed by the
Council, to act in the place of Mr. Sigler) to accept the trust, as incon-,
sistent with his office of judge, and the great distance of this seat of dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />content
and disorganization from the head of the acting authorities of
of Texas; have all contributed to give impunity and success to the lead<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers
of the opposition to the country’s interests and safety. This turbu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lent
insubordination to all order and government, your committee hoped
to have seen subdued by means of a mild course, thus far pursued in all
our councils concerning the authors of such dangerous practices. Your
committee advise the appointment of G. W. Smith as a committee to act
with Dr. Everitt and Judge Forbes, in carrying into effect the fourteenth
section of the organic law; and advise that the provisions of the ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nance
and decree of this Government, referred to by Judge Forbes, as
inducing his unwillingness to act in the matter, does not contemplate
this case. The objects of that law are clearly confined to officers, and do
not extend to agencies, of which this is considered as one.</p>

<p>And the committee further advise, that the Governor be requested on
returning the commission to Judge Forbes, so to instruct him and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quest
his acceptance of the trust, as for the good of his country. And
vour committee recommend that the Governor instruct the commission<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers,
that their duties are plainly comprehended in the language of the
fourteenth section of the said organic law; which is to take all papers,
archives, &amp;c., from the several land offices, and deposite them in safe
places, &amp;c. subject to the order of the Governor and Council; that their
duties extend equally to such archives of the political chiefs, alcaldes
and all other officers as are relating to lands, and to command all such
officers and all persons engaged in surveying and locating lands, to cease
their operations, until the future orders of this or a succeeding govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of Texas. All this the said commissioners are authorized and em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />powered
to effect; but in case of resistance on the part of any one con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />templated
in this act, no mode of power. or compulsion seems given to
the commissioners, consequently provision must be made by Government.</p>

<p>By the last section of the organic law, full and ample powers are
vested in the Governor and Council to carry into effect the said organic
law, and all the decrees and resolutions of the Convention. The Council
must determine the mode, the Governor see to the execution.</p>

<pb ed="unknown" n="161" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>Your committee therefore advise that the Governor be authorized and
required to make out in a proper manner, the common law writ of assist-,
ance, commanding all officers, whether civil or military, and all good
citizens of Texas, to be at any and at all times, when required, aiding and
assisting said commissioners, or any two of them, in the execution of said
commission, and that on any person or persons refusal, when thus called
upon by virtue of such writ of assistance, to render prompt and efficient
aid, he or they shall be fined in a summary way, on due proof, in any sum
not extending over one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Your committee further advise, that the Governor in his instructions
to said commissioners, require them to use all possible prudence and for<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bearance,
consistent with the honor and dignity of the state, in the
execution of their trust, and not resort to physical force, until other
measures are exhausted and unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Your committee being sensibly impressed with the necessity of framing
an ordinance for the better defining the duties of judges and other offi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cers
of justice, and regulating fees, &amp;c. recommend that the proper com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
be required to report an ordinance to the Council without further
delay, and said committee already merits the just censure of this House
for so long delaying a duty imperatively required of the Government by
the organic law; but advise, that all judges having a knowledge of the
common law of England, will at once see their duties explained in the
administration of criminal justice, and in writs of Habeas Corpus as well
in the definition of crimes, as in the form of executing the laws. The
principles are applicable throughout, and well adapted to the understand<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
and habits of our citizens generally. For testamentary powers are
also given to judges. And your committee advise that these powers are.
regulated by the heretofore existing laws of the land, whether provided
by the statutes, or as regulated by the law partidas, or other principles of
the civil law.</p>

<p>Notarial powers are to be executed under and by the provisions of
the same laws, with this difference, perhaps, that all judges are, by the
organic law made public notaries without a special commission.</p>

<p>Attachments, sequestrations and arrests are regulated by the civil code
and code of practice of the state of Louisiana. All other civil proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings
being suspended, until otherwise directed by the Government, your
committee would advise that it would be impossible to give further in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />structions
upon the duties of judges unless by “writing out a system of
laws, copied from all the above, which have long been in use in Texas.</p>

<p>From other documents referred, your committee are satisfied, that the
postmaster of Nacogdoches greatly contributes to the prevailing dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />orders
and discontents among the people there, by withholding communi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cations
calculated to inform and undeceive them, as respects the acts of
their convention and of the Government; and acting in concert with the
land speculators and other evil disposed persons, to the great injury of
the public tranquillity and safety; and therefore advise that the post<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />master
general be required to discharge the said postmaster at Nacog<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />doches
from office, and appoint some one, whose patriotism and love of
order will produce a respect for the Government of the people, and obe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dience
to the laws.</p>

<p>Another subject worthy of consideration is presented to your commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee
by the papers referred, which is an appropriation of public monies in

<pb n="710" xml:id="P0710" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/718/" />

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

Nacogdoches, for the necessary expenses of the commissioners, and pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
express riders between the Government and Nacogdoches. No pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vision
has been made for compensation to commissioners, or for their
necessary contingent expenses; and as frequent communications may be
required between the commissioners of that department and the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
your committee advise that the said commissioners be authorized
to draw upon the collector of Nacogdoches from time to time, so that
the whole sum shall not exceed five hundred dollars, which shall be ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />counted
for, and settled in the same manner of other public accounts;
and that said commissioners be instructed, to keep the Government reg<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ularly
advised of their proceedings, until they shall be able to report
their trust executed.</p>

<p>Your committee, therefore advise the adoption of the following reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lutions.</p>

<p>1.	Resolved, that John Forbes be requested to accept his appointmnt
as a commissioner in the Nacogdoches department, to unite in carrying
into effect the provisions of the fourteenth section of the organic law
of the Provisional Government of Texas; and that his acceptance there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />of
is hereby declared compatible with his duties as judge.</p>

<p>2.	Resolved, that G. W. Smith be, and he is hereby appointed a com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioner
for the aforesaid department, for carrying into effect the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions
of the said fourteenth section of the organic law; and that the
Governor be required to instruct the commissioners of said department,
agreeably to the foregoing report, a copy of which shall be furnished him
with these resolutions.</p>

<p>3.	Resolved, that the said commissioners be,and they are hereby author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ized
to draw upon the collector of the department of Nacogdoches, "from
time to time, for any sum or sums, in all not to exceed five hundred dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars,
and that they account for, and settle the same, in the same manner
as other officers of the Government.</p>

<p>4.	Resolved, that the post master general be required to dismiss Henry
Raguet, the postmoster of Nacogdoches, and appoint some one in his
place of known integrity, and who will respect and obey the laws of the
land.</p>

<p>5.	Resolved, that the Governor at his pleasure, may give instructions
to any judge commissioned by him, agreeably to the provisions contained
in the foregoing report.</p>

<p>6.	Resolved, that the Council will render the executive every neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary
assistance, by advice or other suitable co-operation, in giving prompt
and efficient execution to the duties of the department; and in giving
stability and confidence to the Government, by uniting in prudent and
wise councils for the protection of the people, and the safety of the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try,
involved in the calamities of disorganizers at home, and war within
our borders.</p>

<p>7.	Resolved, that the Governor be required to execute and carry into
full effect the fourteenth section of the organic law, as contemplated by
its provisions throughout all Texas; and that he be vested with full pow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers
to do so.</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p>To the Honorable, the President, and
<lb />Members of the Lefsla tive Council:
</p>

<p>GENTLEMBN:—</p>

<p>I have received and considered the ordinance creating the offices of
auditor and comptroller of public accounts, which also assigned to each
their duties. On this bill I have but few observations to make or objec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
to raise. But two only, both of which would be easily complied
with, the first will be found in the last clause of the fifth section. I
would suggest the propriety of striking out the last clause from the word
“provided," which is underscored to the end of the section. This clause
is in itself rather ambiguous, and if not leaving a do,or open to fraud,
will be calculated to excite jealousy and suspicion. All money drawn
from the treasury should be subject to the same routine; and the proper
guards and checks interposed to detect fraud, and no
branch of the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
should retain exclusive privileges in such matters. For if no
other injuries should result, it would at least have a tendency to produce
complexity and a confusion in the office.</p>

<p>The other amendment which I wish to suggest, is only for the purpose
of evading ambiguity, and that the matter be plainly understood; which
by continuing the ninth section by adding the words, “After the claim
has once been adjudicated and filed” which would show that it was in
compensation for extra labor.</p>

<p>I also transmit to you various resolutions, &amp;c. which I have signed,
and where necessary, complied with. The resolution to correspond with

<pb n="713" xml:id="P0713" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/721/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="165" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

Mr. Lamar of Georgia, will be complied with so soon as an opportunity
-offers.</p>

<p>I also send you the correspondence received from Bexar; it is however,
principally of an introductory character, speaking of men who are
deemed worthy to be considered in time of office making. Captain Cook
of the New Orleans Greys, is highly recommended by all, both for his
ability, and distinguished bravery as an officer, and if possible I would

<p>Your committee on state and judiciary, to whom was referred the

<p>The Judge Wilson alluded to, was made so by an election of this

his having received the suffrage of his municipality. The fault then is not
so much ours; should his habits of inebriety be to the extent spoken of, in

against him, in accordance with the eleventh section of the organic law,
we are of opinion that this Council cannot take consideration of the case,

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceedings being read,</p>

<p>Mr. Clements, from the select committee appointed for that purpose,
made the following report, which was read and adopted:</p>

<p>The special committee of three, who were appointed to draft an ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dress
to the people, in which should be set forth the reasons why the
General Council have hot opened the land offices; and at the same time,
to satisfy every settler and emigrant, that his landed interest is and shall
be protected by the Provisional Government of Texas, beg leave to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port
as follows:</p>

<p>1st The third act of the organic law declares that no law shall be
passed, except the emergency of the country requires it.</p>

<p>2d. The fourteenth article of the organic law declares, that the land
offices shall remain closed, until they can be systematized by competent
authorities to be hereafter established.</p>

<p>3d. The fifteenth section of the organic law declares, that all persons
who have emigrated to Texas, or who may emigrate during the present
conflict for constitutional liberty, and perform the duties of citizens,
shall be entitled to the benefits of the colonization laws, under which
they emigrated or such laws as may be in force, at the time of their emi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gration.</p>

<p>Your committee would therefore recommend to every citizen who has
not received lands, in accordance with the colonization laws under which
they emigrated, and to those who are now emigrating, or who
may hereafter emigrate, to select and settle themselves upon
any vacant lands of Texas, until. the Land Office can be sys<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tematized,
and surveys of their lands made, and titles to the same given.
At the same time settling themselves at suitable distances from each
other, so that no difficulty may hereafter occur in surveying their lands,
or giving titles to the same.</p>

<p>And further, that the General Council pass no law that will impair
the just and legal contracts and obligations made and entered into by
empresarios or commissioners, with actual settlers or emigrants; but abide
by, and conform to the provisions of the organic law, made by the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention
in all their acts and proceedings, touching the land offices, or the
rights of settlers and emigrants.</p>

<p>If the above report should be adopted by the honorable the General

<p>Be it resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government
of Texas, that the Governor be required to have published three times, in

<p>Resolutions requiring the Governor to publish the ordinances and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />crees
of the Provisional Government of Texas.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Governor be, and he is hereby required to have all

of Texas, immediately published in the "Texian and Emigrants’

<p>Resolved, that it shall be the duty of the Governor, to cause that his
executive secretary immediately make complete transcripts of said ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nances,

advances, transmit the same, to the several newspapers aforesaid for pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lication.</p>

<p>Resolved, that for the expenses of such publication, funds shall be ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />propriated
in the treasury subject to the Governor’s order, through the
usual mode of settling accounts.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett presented an ordinance and decree appointing collectors

his excellency the Provisional Governor, to order through his proper offi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cers
at Bexar, the captains of companies to report muster rolls of their
companies, setting forth the number of men, for what time they enlisted,,
when they enlisted, whether in the regular army or auxiliary corps, and
every thing relative to their condition and situation.</p>

<p>Your committee further recommends, that his excellency the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor,
be requested to order his proper officers to report the true condi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the ordnance department at Bexar; how many pieces of artillery;,
the ammunition and supplies of said department; the tools and instru<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments
necessary for making and repairing fortifications; and everything
connected therewith.</p>

<p>Your committee recommends this course because it is impossible for'
the General Council to order supplies, or make provision for a garrison
or any military post, without knowing its situation and condition in every
respect.</p>

<p>Your committee would further suggest the propriety and necessity
of ascertaining from the officers at Bexar, or commanding officers, what
companies were at Bexar, when the place was taken, together with a mus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter
roll of their company if it is possible to be done.</p>

<p>Therefore be it resolved by the General Council of the Provisional
Government of Texas, that his Excellency the Governor, be requested
to carry into effect the foregoing report; and that the secretary of the'

with the necessity of adopting some measures as recommended in
said letters to prevent the importation or emigration of free negroes or
mulattoes into Texas; being sensible from the experience of other coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tries,
that the residence of such free negroes and mulattoes among us,
would prove an evil difficult to be remedied should it once be tolerated.
To the slave-holder nothing could be of deeper interest than the timely
adoption of some measures that will prove effectually preventive of a

and disobedience into the brain of the honest and contented

<head>Executive Department of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable President, and members
<lb />of the General Council:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>I herewith transmit to your body the report of John H. Money, former
treasurer of this municipality. You will see by the accompanying vouch<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers,
the disbursements made by him, some of them you may deem it neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary
to consider. Mr. Money is anxious to bring the matter to a close by
final settlement. I also send you a petition, signed by various persons,
which will show for itself. I further have to remark, that the reports
made by the commandant at Goliad, shows that he has on hand at that
station, public property to a considerable amount, consisting of various
goods; dues to the custom house, &amp;c., all of which he is anxious should
be properly disposed of for the public benefit. You will therefore make
such orders on that subject as you may deem necessary, to promote the
public interest, and at the same time to release the commandant from the
further responsibility.</p>

<p>I am gentlemen, respectfully</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>January 2d, 1836.</p>

<p>The message was accompanied by sundry documents. The report of
John H. Money, treasurer, was referred to the committee on finance.</p>

<p>The petition for a new municipality to be taken from the west side of
the municipality of Austin, which, also accompanied the message, was re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
to the committee on state and judiciary.</p>

<p>The account of William McDermot, for services and losses in the vol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />unteer

consisting of Messrs Thompson and Kerr.</p>

<p>On motion, the Council adjourned till seven o’clock, p. m.</p>

<head>SEVEN O’CLOCK, P. M.</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the committee on state and judiciary, made the fol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lowing
report, accompanied by resolutions; which being read the report
was adopted, and the resolutions passed unanimously.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the General Council of the
<lb />Provisional Government of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on the state and judiciary, to whom was referred
several communications from the commissioners to the United States of
the north, and communications concerning the Creek Indians, respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
report, that they cannot but express much surprise, that our public
agents have so long delayed to proceed to the fulfilment of the objects
of their appointment: that, however, he Government may feel inclined
to receive and respect the counsels of these gentlemen, and that of all
others interested in the fate of Texas, yet duties of a different character

<pb n="724" xml:id="P0724" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/732/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="176" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

having been assigned to our public agents to the United States of the
north, it cannot be expected that they will devote their time to instruct<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the Government at home; when as the agents of that Government,
they have higher and more important duties, which they are pledged to
perform abroad.</p>

<p>Your committee would further respectfully suggest, that if they were
disposed to listen to the projects proposed by the commissioners, in the
communications referred, the men and means for carrying these plans
into effect are wanting, and can only be obtained by the active exertions
of our public agents in the fulfilment of the duties assigned them. Al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ready
one half of the time allotted to the fulfilment of the trust com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mitted
to them is expired, and no efficient measures, seem to have been
adopted, for even opening a communication with those sources from
which our aid is expected through their negotiation.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore advise that the Governor be requested im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediately
to communicate instructions to the said commissioners, as to
the necessity of proceeding with all possible despatch to such points in
the United States of the north, as shall enable them with the greatest
certainty to effect the objects of their mission. And that he instruct
them as soon as possible to forward supplies to the regular army to the
port of Copano or the nearest point thereto, which prudence or safety
may suggest. And that they be further instructed by the Governor in
such a manner as shall best conform to the arrangement of the present
campaign against the enemy, adopted by the Provisional Government;
to direct the transmission of munitions of Avar and supplies to carry the
same into effect, and to keep the Government regularly advised of all
their proceedings, and the prospect of their final success.</p>

<p>Your committee further report to this honorable House that they
have received information to be relied upon of contemplated arrange<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments
being entered into between certain citizens of Texas and a large
body of Creek Indians of the United States of the North, for selling
lands to and locating said Indians within the territories of Texas; a
course dangerous to the country and in the highest degree criminal and
unpardonable on the part of those engaged in this wicked enterprize.
Your committee therefore advise on this subject, that the Governor
instruct our said commissioners, to remonstrate with the government of
the United States of the North, against permitting the Indians to enter
into our territories, for the purpose of settling among us, as calculated
to increase the dangers and troubles in which we are now involved, strug<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ling
for our very existence with a gigantic power, and harrassed by the
almost daily depreciations of Indians already within our borders; and to
appeal to the justice, the magnanimity and sympathies of our northern
brethren, to prevent such an accumulation of etuis and horrors, upon our
devoted land.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore advise the adoption of the following reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lutions:</p>

<p>1. Resolved, that the Governor he requested to communicate instruc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
to Stephen F. Austin, William H. Wharton and B. T. Archer,
agreeably to the views and principles, laid down in the foregoing report,
together with the report and accompanying resolutions, and such ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditional
instructions as the exigencies of the case may seem to require.</p>

<p>2.	Resolved, that the Governor be requested to open a correspondence
with such persons in Nacogdoches as will be likely to disclose the names
of those citizens of Texas engaged in the negotiation with the Creek In<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dians,
the extent to which the same has already been carried, and its
nature, and the object thereby intended, and that he lay the same before
the Council as soon as possible together with his own views upon the
subject.</p>

<p>3.	Resolved, that a copy of the foregoing report, and resolutions, sign<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed
by the President and secretary of this House be sent to his Excellency

<p>Mr. Kerr presented an ordinance and decree defining the boundaries

poned till the fourth day of July next.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson, from the select committee, to whom was referred the
account of William McDermott, made report, recommending that an
order be drawn on the Treasurer in favor of said McDermott, by the
chairman of the committee of finance, in the sum of one hundred and
twenty-two dollars, sixty-five cents; which report was adopted, and the
chairman of the committee of finance, directed to draw said order for
the aforesaid amount, in favor of William McDermott.</p>

<p>The following accounts were presented and allowed, and the chair<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />man
of the committee of finance directed to draw orders in favor of the
respective individuals for their several amounts, upon the Treasurer, viz:</p>

<p>Mariano Cavero, fourteen dollars, contingent expenses of the House.</p>

<p>Joseph Doan, fifty-eight dollars.</p>

<p>B.	C. Wallace, eight dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall presented the following resolution, which was adopted:</p>

<p>Resolved, that John W. Moore be allowed an additional sum of three

Wood was duly elected.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Clements, the House proceeded to elect a clerk to
the committees on military, land, indian and naval affairs. When E. W.

<p>On motion, the House adjourned till nine o’clock to-morrow morning.</p>

<lb />nine o’clock, A. M.
</head>

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceedings being read,</p>

<p>Mr. Wood, elected to several committees of this House, as their clerk,
was sworn and entered upon his duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett presented the petition of John Brock, which was read
and referred to the committee on military affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett presented a recommendation of M. D. Ayres, for the office
of comptroller, which was read and ordered to be placed on file.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the committee of the state and judiciary, made the
following report, which together with the annexed resolution was
adopted:</p>

<p>Report of the committee on the state and judiciary to whom was re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
the communication of Matthew Caldwell.</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the communication of Mat<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />thew
Caldwell, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave
to report that the outrage complained of in said letter, to wit: The as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sault
and injury committed on the person of the complainant is, in
their opinion, one of those lawless modes, assumed by wicked and ma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />licious
individuals, of gratifying their vindictiveness, which it should
be the care of all civilized communities to suppress.</p>

<p>In a community governed by laws, the law of the land designs a rem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />edy
for every right and prescribes a punishment for every offence. And
not until it shall appear clearly, that the law can not interpose, is an in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dividual
justified in resorting to physical force even to prevent injury
to his person or property. All acts of violence by individuals, then, to
the persons or property of others, are presumed to be contrary to law,
and detrimental to the peace and good order of society, unless it shall be
plainly shown, that the perpetrator acted from necessity.</p>

<p>Your committee, therefore believing, from the letter referred, that
Matthew Caldwell has been thus wickedly and unlawfully assaulted,
whereby his health has been greatly injured, and his life endangered,
and is yet in danger; woud respectfully recommend to the House the
adoption of the following resolution:</p>

<p>Resolved by the General Council of the Provisional Government of
Texas, that the Governor be required to issue his proclamation, offering
one hundred and fifty dollars to any person who shall arrest and commit
to prison Joseph P. Laller, who on Saturday, the ------- day of
December, 1835, assaulted, beat and severely wounded Matthew Caldwell
of Gonzales, so that his life' was and is yet in great danger.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the same committee, also made a verbal report,

for a new municipality to be called “Colorado,” which report was adopt<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed,

affairs.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, Mr. Clements was authorized to procure

<p>The Council met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall submitted a report from Mr. Caldwell, sub-contractor at
Gonzales, which was referred to the committee on military affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. McMullen, from the committee of finance, made the following
report, which was read and adopted:</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the proposition of Colonel
Barrett, to furnish the Provisional Government with an useful library
of law books, civil and political history, political economy, &amp;c., beg
leave to report to your honorable body, that we approve of the proposi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
in part, and do most earnestly recommend to the General Council
to accept of the proposition so far as to embrace the list of books or
works, affixed to this report, together with such works as the wisdom
of your honorable body, may add to said list; for it is impossible for us,
for the little time, which more pressing business has allowed us to be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stow
upon the subject, to recollect every book which may be important,
for you to examine and refer to, in the formation of so complicated a
system as that of Government. Yet to purchase the number of volumes,
which Colonel Barrett set forth in his proposition, would be, in our
humble opinion, in the present distracted and impoverished state of
the country, unwise, and give just cause of offence to a large majority
of our fellow-citizens; they would instantly say, you advance one thous<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />and
dollars for a library, containing two thousand volumes; when you
have not one cent to give to him who has suffered every privation, and
risked every danger in defence of his country.</p>

<p>It would not only displease the people, but it would be bad policy,
and would be an expenditure of money which is not absolutely required
at this time. If our finance were in a flourishing condition, and our
state at peace with the world, we would recommend you to purchase
double the number of volumes proposed, for a state library, though

subject, together with my own solicitations, will, I confidentially hope,

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall, the chairman of the committee of finance,

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, made the following
report, which was read and adopted:</p>

<p>The communication of General F. W. Johnson, which was referred
to your committee, respecting an expedition against Matamoras, has had
the same under consideration, and beg leave to report, to the honorable
the General Council, that it is an expedition of the utmost importance
at this time. It will give employment to the volunteers, until a regular
army, sufficient for the protection of our country, can be raised and
organized.</p>

<p>And your committee take great pleasure in recommending F. W.
Johnson to take the command of all the troops that he can raise for
that purpose. His gallant and chivalrous conduct at the seige and fall
of Bexar, entitles him to our confidence and support. Besides, delay
at this time on our part, would be dangerous. For if the volunteers
on their march for Matamoras were defeated, the consequence resulting
from it might prove fatal to Texas. But every one must foresee the
benefit that would result from occupying and keeping possession, of that
important and commercial depot. It would not only deprive our ene<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mies

the service of Texas in one month, will give us the entire command of
the Gulf, from Matamoras to New Orleans, over our enemies.</p>

<p>Your committee would further recommend that measures be adopted
by the honorable the General Council, to support, sustain, and provide
for the volunteer army on their march against Matamoras; and further,,
that the Governor be requested to commission such officers, as are re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ported
to have been elected by said volunteers, or as may be reported
to him. Your committee further recommend that the sum of two thous<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />and
dollars be appropriated for the expenses of the expedition to Mata<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moras.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett on behalf of the state committee, and committee on naval
affairs, to whom was referred the letters of Thomas F. McKinney and
McKinney &amp; Williams made the following report:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the General Council of the Provisional Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred communications from McKin<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ney
&amp; Williams and Thomas F. McKinney, will respectfully suggest to
the House their views, first in regard to the purchase of certain vessels
offered to the Government by said McKinney &amp; Williams.</p>

<p>First. As regards the Schooner “William Robbins.” The subject of
this vessel has often been before the Council, and until a personal interview
of your committee with Mr. McKinney the facts had not been fully
known. It seems, however, from Mr. McKinney’s statement, that cer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain
individuals, connected with the committee of safety of Matagorda,
before the meeting of the convention entered into an arrangement for
the purchase of this vessel as a joint property, to be used in the protec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the commerce of the country. This company drew upon Messrs.
McKinney &amp; Williams for three thousand five hundred dollars, the price
of the vessel, but Mr. McKinney believing it were better to be placed
under the control of the Government, purchased her on his own respon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sibility,
leaving to the Government to take her or not, as they might
think expedient.</p>

<p>Your committee advise, that a competent agent be appointed to ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />amine
this vessel and its equipments; and if it shall appear to be a vessel
which can be put to good use in the public service, with a corresponding
price, your committee recommends the purchase.</p>

<p>Your committee further report: that Messrs. McKinney and Williams,
through Mr. Williams, have made a purchase of, and equipped a schooner
of about one hundred and twenty-six tons burthen, adapted to the ob<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ject
of protecting our commerce against the enemy. This vessel called
the “Invincible,” is now in the bay of Galveston, and is generously offered
to the Government of Texas, by the owners, at first cost and charges.
Your committee are clearly of opinion that every possible effort should
be made to protect our own commerce, and to embarrass and destroy
that of the enemy; and by the plan contemplated for the future opera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
of the army, both the munitions of war and supplies must be
transported by water, consequently, a sufficient naval force is indis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pensable
for giving certainty and effects to the objects of our future cam<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />paign
as intended; and this naval preparation must be speedily made.
Your committee therefore advise that a suitable agent be appointed to
examine the schooner “Invincible” and her equipments, and if suited

<pb n="731" xml:id="P0731" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/739/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="183" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

to the objects of cruizing in the Gulf, or about our coasts that an im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mediate
purchase be made of the vessel of Messrs. McKinney &amp; Williams
upon such terms'as the future means of the country will justify.</p>

<p>Your committee also advise the necessity of adopting an immediate
system of officering and manning such vessels, as may belong to the
public service; and that inasmuch as no system of regulating naval opera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
has ever existed in Texas, and time and circumstances render it
utterly- impossible to form and arrange one adapted to our necessities
in season to give effect to our present operations; it is recommended
that the naval system as adopted and practised in the United States
of the north, regulate the proceedings of this department of our defence
in Texas. Your committee also advise that in the event of purchasing
the vessels aforesaid, the Governor be directed to communicate the same
to our public agents in the United States of the north, that their pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chases
of vessels for public service may be regulated accordingly.</p>

<p>The report was read and adopted, and was accompanied by an ordi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nance,
which was read the first time, and the rule suspended, and read a
second time, and ordered to lie on the table until to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, from the same committee, also made the following report,
which was read and adopted:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable the General Council of the Provisional Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on state and judiciary to whom were referred certain
communications of Thomas F. McKinney, declining the appointment as
Commissary General, and in relation to General Mexia:</p>

<p>Respectfully report, that the interest and safety of the country mainly
depend upon the useful and active employment of troops engaged in her
defence, and that certain and efficient action cannot be expected, unless
the proper supplies of munitions of war and means of subsistence, be
promptly and plentifully supplied, at the different posts within the range
of their operations. And that such provision is necessarily entrusted to
a separate department, which should be unincumbered with other duties.
For this purpose, a commissary general, being a providing commissary
for the armies, is usual in all well regulated Governments especially in

time of war. To this end such an office was created by the Provisional
Government of T’exas, and as a suitable individual to fill this highly im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />portant’and
honorable post, this House determined upon Thomas P. Mc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />Kinney
to become the head of this department and accordingly so ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointed
him. Your committee cannot but regret the reluctance of Mr.
McKinney to accept the trust, and therefore advise that he be requested,
under all the circumstances connected with the present situation of Texas,
to accept his commission, or to act as a special agent of the Government
in performing the duties of that department, until some other suitable
individual shall be known, who will relieve him of the duties.</p>

<p>As regards the communication concerning General Mexia, your com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
do not incline to censure any of the proceedings of this body, in
relation to him, acting as they did, from information received at different
times, showing indecision in the character and determination nf General
Mexia, and hearing his conduct complained of, by those who had been
under his command, every action of this House in relation to this matter,
has resulted from a sense of duty to the country. But your committee
are clearly of opinion, that the declaration of November the seventh, and
organic law, -which constitutes the basis of the "Provisional Government”
of Texas, and the solemn obligations of the members who compose that
Government to sustain its principles, in spirit and in letter, are funda<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mental
principles that must be observed, as well for the present safety of
our citizens, and future hopes of security to the country, as for the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scientious
fulfilment of the duties they assume. And whatever may be
the private feelings in regard to any other policy, all attempts to. sustain
principles, and carry into effect plans, differing from that already adopted,
would be in the minds of your committee in the highest degree criminal,
in any officer, who has assumed the responsibilities of acting under its
provisions and directions. Our course therefore is a plain one, while sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />porting
the republican principles of the constitution of 1824, which places
us as one of the belligerents in a civil war, we are required to co-operate
and act in concert with all Mexican citizens, also favorable to the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />federation,
and opposed to the central form of Government, in doing this
we fulfil a paramount duty, and pursue the dictates of the clearest policy
for sustaining Texas in her present dangerous conflict.</p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>Captain E. Hall,</p>

<p>Sir—Yours of the ninth ult. has been received and read in Council.
We rejoice that the proceedings of our Convention have been 'so well
received by the friends of Texas in N ew Orleans. We hope the doings of
the Council may prove equally satisfactory to those, whose good opinions
and confidence, it is our wish and interest to secure. If patriotism and
honest intentions can effect this object, we shall be gratified.</p>

<p>The fruits of our victory over the enemy and the capitulation of Bexar,
have given us possession of more than thirty pieces of artillery of various
calibre, and in a great measure superseded the necessity of the purchases
to have been made by you in behalf of this Government. But our work
is by no means finished. The enemy is endeavoring to concentrate and
bring upon us a large force which must be met and vanquished as soon
as possible after he takes the field: munitions of war and supplies of pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions
to be landed at or near the port of Copano as circumstances will
admit, is all important to our present and contemplated future opera- ■
tions. Whatever can be done by you, in this way, and sending volunteers
to the same destination, will aid your adopted country in the struggle for
freedom and constitutional rights. A cordon of posts are being estab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished
from Bexar by Goliad to San Patricio on the Rio Nueces, and gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment
agents will be stationed at each post to receive and provide for
volunteers, and take charge of all public stores. Indeed, we hope to ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tend
the line to Matamoras at no very distant time.</p>

<p>The volunteers on board the Santiago have arrived, and will, we trust,
be'profitably and honorably employed in the glorious cause. The grati<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tude
of the country, and we hope more substantial testimonies will be
secured to our brave and magnanimous brethren of the north. The
struggle once over, and peace restored to the fair lands of Texas; what
that the fondest wishes of the philanthropist could extend to man on
earth, may not be expected here? The rich reward of our labors and our
dangers is ever in view, and immediate possession but awaits the success<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ful
termination of the present struggle.</p>

<p>We hope you have met the government commissioners ere this and that
success will attend all your efforts in favor of oppressed Texas. We shall
expect to hear from you as often as your convenience will permit, as
matters of interest to our cause shall transpire.</p>

<p>Very respectfully, yours,</p>

<p>D. C. BARRETT,
<lb />Chairman, of Committee of State and Judiciary.</p>

<p>Council Room,
<lb />San Felipe, January 3, 1836.</p>

<p>The same committee also made the following report, which was read
and adopted:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable the General Council of the Provisional Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>Your committee on state and judiciary, to whom was referred the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munications
of Thomas F. McKinney in their report, which is respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
submitted, beg leave to say,</p>

<pb n="735" xml:id="P0735" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/743/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="187" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>That it is not the design of this House to pass any ordinance or decree
to operate as an ex post facto law, or by any movement to surprize those
upon whom their decrees and ordinances are intended to operate, and
although their proceeding have been governed by emergencies; yet it has
been the especial care of the Council to avoid,' in their enactments, the
adoption of any measures, that might operate unequally. And most
especially have they, and will they, avoid the adoption of such measures,
as might effect most prejudicially, those who are most active in the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try’s
service, and deserve most at their country’s hands. And your com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
feel themselves fully authorized to say, that whenever this House
discerns that any of its acts have, or are likely to have this tendency and
effect, they will, without hesitation, relieve by immediate counter-action.
It seems however, from the communication referred, that the case’ there
complained of, is just such an one, as it has been the object of the Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil
to guard against, and calls for, and deserves the immediate interposi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
and relief of this House.</p>

<p>The circumstances as gathered from the letter referred, are that before
the passage, by this House, of an ordinance laying imposts and tonnage,
and before it was even in contemplation McKinney &amp; Williams had gone
abroad, as had been their custom, to purchase and import their supplies
of goods and merchandize, and in full time to have them imported before
the passage of the impost and tonnage laws; but being detained, in con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sequence
of the difficulties in which the country was involved, and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />layed
too by their engagements in her behalf; in procuring arms and
vessels for her defence, the ordinance was passed, and their stock of
merchandize much larger than usual, in consequence of the increased de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand
of the country, are now subject to heavy duties. While other mer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />chants
more attentive to their own immediate interests, than their coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try’s
weal, have escaped the consequences of the law.</p>

<p>Your committee, therefore, respectfully advise that the Government
interpose in behalf of McKinney &amp; Williams in this instance, and that
they be released from the payment of the duties imposed by said law, as
regards their present importations; and for that purpose your committee
would respectfully submit the accompanying ordinance, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The ordinance accompanying the above report was read the first time,
and the rule suspended, when it was read a second and third time, when
the question was taken on its final passage, and decided in the affirmative.</p>

<p>The same committee, through their chairman, Mr. Barrett, also made
the following report, which was read and adopted:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable President and members of the General Council:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on state and judiciary, to whom was referred the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceeding
of the volunteers of Goliad, in favor of independence, and the
proceedings of a public meeting held at Texana, upon the same subject—</p>

<p>Report, that the free expression of opinion in all matters of Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
is a right unquestioned among a free people, but when opinions
become declarations, solemnly adopted by a few, adverse to the principles,
and in their execution destructive to the very existence of the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
the right of free discussion is transcended, and the safety of a
whole community jeoparded, by the premature acts of a small part. The

<pb ed="unknown" n="188" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

last declaration of the volunteers at Goliad, savors greatly of the latter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />character, but is believed to have been inconsiderately adopted, without
designing to produce the consequences to the country inevitable upon its
execution. Of this fact your committee have been advised by the agents,
through whom the documents was transmitted to this House, and who
had been appointed to superintend its publication in the newspapers of
Texas; and which agents, on being convinced of the evil tendency of
further troubling our citizens by exciting and distracting subjects have
prudently agreed to withhold all further publicity of which, they have
advised their constituents, and merely request that the copy of the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings
be permitted to remain upon the files of the Secretary of this
House. This your committee advise may be properly done.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the meeting at Texana are without objections, be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
opinions offered to their fellow citizens, merely advising and for their
consideration. The question of a declaration of independence, is vastly
interesting and important in itself, and requires deep and long considera<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
from the people themselves.</p>

<p>The causes and effects of such a measure should be freely discussed to
be well understood, and no action should be had upon a subject, so vital<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ly
important to the present and future destinies of Texas, until the pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lic
mind is. well informed and harmonized, to meet all consequences,
firmly, and secure from self reproach.</p>

<p>The members composing the Provisional Government under its exist<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
organization, as such, have no choice in directing their words or ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions.
The line of conduct is plainly defined to them, and to be consist<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ent
and just to themselves, their words must harmonize with their ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions.
All discussions in this Blouse upon subjects at variance with its
very existence, which we have severally sworn to support, must be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />garded
as forbidden to us here, whatever our private opinion, may bp as to
the future policy to be adopted by the people of Texas. Time only can
determine the correctness of any man’s view's, as regards the attitude to
be assumed by this country in her political relations to the world. Offi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cially,
we are commanded "to touch not, handle not the unclean thing.”
As we severally fulfil our solemn obligations to our country, so shall.we
be cheered with the blessings of an approving conscience, and the smiles.
of the omnipotent and just God.</p>

<p>Jesse Burnham appeared, and took the oath of office as a member of
this Council from the municipality of Austin.</p>

<p>Mr. Clements from the committee on military affairs,' presented the
following report, which was read and ordered to lie on the table:</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the communications and reports
received from P. Dimit, commandant at Goliad, have had the same under
consideration, and we beg leave to report that it is important to afford,
as far as in our power such relief to Captain Dimit as he asks for. He
states officially, that he is in want of provisions, and that many troops
under his command have families, who are entirely dependent upon their
labor for subsistence, and that they have been in the service of Texas
from the commencement of the war.</p>

<p>Your committee would therefore recommend, that Captain Dimitt,
through his contractor or commissary, procure such supplies and provi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sions
for the troops under his command as are necessary for them, until
provisions and supplies can be sent to that post by an agent in New Or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />leans.
And that further, he be authorized to appoint a suitable contractor
to obtain said provisions, in the place of the one already appointed by the
General Council.</p>

<p>Your committee would further recommend that Captain Dimit be
earnestly requested to remain commandant at Goliad, and to keep as
many of the troops at present under his command, as will remain at that
post.</p>

<p>Your committee further recommends that the commandant at Goliad,
be authorized and empowered to dispose of the public property under his
charge at Goliad, by public vendue, after giving ten days notice of said
sale, and for the money due by the Government to the troops at that fort

<pb n="740" xml:id="P0740" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/748/" />

to be considered as cash paid by said troops for such articles, as they
may wish to purchase, to that amount for which Government may be
indebted to them for their services, in all cases taking sufficient vouchers
from said troops. Provided, that said commandant shall not dispose of
any public property that will be necessary for the use of the army.</p>

<p>Your committee would further recommend to the Honorable the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Council, to request his Excellency the Governor, to order troops
to the relief of the Commandant of Goliad, and further, should Captain
P. Dimit resign the command which he now holds at the fort of Goliad,
that he be and is hereby requested to make out a complete muster roll and
army report to the Provisional Government, of the troops, their names,
and every thing connected with the situation of said fort; the quantity of
provisions and ammunition; and also the officer whom he leaves in com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand.
Your committee would further recommend the adoption of the
following resolutions:</p>

<p>Resolved, By the General Council of the Provisional Government of
Texas, that his Excellency the Governor be, and he is hereby required
to correspond with the Commandant at Goliad, P. Dimit, as to the course
recommended in the foregoing report by your committee, and to give
such instructions as may be necessary to keep possession of said post.</p>

<p>Resolved, further, That a certified copy of the foregoing report and
resolutions, be furnished by the Secretary to the Governor, to be for<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />warded
to P. Dimit, Commandant at Goliad.</p>

<p>James Bowie exhibited to the Council, orders from the Commander
in Chief of the Army, to proceed against Matamoras, and took leave of
the Council for his departure.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Hanks, a committee was appointed, consisting of
Messrs. Hanks and Kerr, to wait on Mr. Bowie and request of him a
copy of his orders for the expedition to Matamoras.</p>

<p>Whereupon the said committee obtained leave of the House and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tired
to execute the duties assigned them.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall, the Auditor and Comptroller are requested
to draw on the Treasurer, in favor of John H. Money, for fourteen dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars,
to be paid out of the funds appropriated for the contingent ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />penses

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p>To the Honorable, the President, and Council:</p>

<p>Gentlemen:—</p>

<p>I made a call on your honorable body, to know if an express could be
immediately sent to New Orleans, with dispatches to our agents. This
I deem absolutely necessary, for reasons before given. Will you please
inform me on that subject. I have ordered the Commander-in-Chief
to establish his headquarters on the frontier, to concentrate all the troops

in Texas, and occupy the most eligible points to afford protection, and
keep the enemy in check, and to have every thing in a state of prepara<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
for active operations, at the earliest possible day. I have been in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />formed
that Messrs. McKinney and Williams have received an armed
vessel, which is now in our waters; before writing to our agents, I would
like to know whether she is intended for the Government or not, and all
the particulars connected therewith, in order that I may advise our
agents particularly on that subject.</p>

<p>I am respectfully, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<p>January 6, 1836.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Clements, the Auditor and Comptroller were re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />quired
to draw on the Treasurer in favor of J. H. Holman, for six dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars,
there being an error in the draft heretofore drawn in his favor, upon
his account, and discharge heretofore allowed and filed.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall, the instructions heretofore given by the
previous Council, to T. F. McKinney, to obtain a loan, were referred
to the committee on the State and Judiciary.</p>

<p>A letter from T. F. McKinney, consenting to act as the special agent
of the Government, in procuring supplies, &amp;c., for the army, was pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sented
by Mr. Clements, read and referred to the committee on State
and Judiciary.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the select committee appointed to wait on James
Bowie, to obtain a copy of his orders, reported and presented a copy
of the same, which was ordered to be filed.</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson, from the select committee appointed to investigate
the account of D. B. Friar, presented the following report, which was
read and adopted.</p>

<p>The special committee to whom was referred the account of D. B.
Friar, superintendent of the ranging corps, as ordered by the permanent
Council, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to report,
as follows. Ten dollars to be deducted from said account for sending an
express, and also ten dollars for shoeing horses; the balance of the ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />count
your committee would recommend to the Honorable the General
Council to receive, as your committee find nothing incorrect in it.</p>

<p>Your committee further recommends, that the quantity of corn, to
wit: thirty-one bushels, and ammunition and provisions, &amp;c., yet on hand,
be used by the rangers who are now in the service, until the regular corps
of rangers can be raised and organised for the protection of the frontier,
and if any should remain, at that time, it can be disposed of, and the
proceeds thereof paid over to the Government; and that two pack horses
be continued in the service as aforesaid, when they can be disposed of,
as before mentioned, by order of the Government.</p>

<p>A. THOMPSON, Chairman.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Clements, it was ordered, that Captain P. Dimitt be
advised, by express, or otherwise, that the Government has paid fourteen
dollars to redeem a horse pledged by his express rider for that sum, and
that Captain Dimitt shall retain in his hands fourteen dollars of said ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />press
rider’s pay, or otherwise secure the same amount, and also to hold
the said express rider responsible for any other property belonging to the

public, that he shall not account for and return, by withholding from him
and retaining its value.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker offered the following resolutions which were read and
adopted:</p>

<p>Be it resolved, By the General Council of the Provisional Government
of Texas, that the name of the Municipality of Tenehaw be and the same
is hereby altered "and changed to that of Shelby, and that all acts here<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after
passed, and business done, shall be in the name of the Municipality
of Shelby.</p>

<p>Be it resolved, &amp;c., That the town of Nashville, be, and the same is
hereby made the seat of Justice for said Municipality of Shelby.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved, &amp;c., That there be an election precinct in the
eastern part of said Municipality, and that the election in said precinct
shall be holden at the residence of James B. Jackson; and that hereafter
for all elections for said Municipality, polls shall be opened at said place,
and correct returns of the votes given in by the persons superintending
said elections, made to the seat of Justice at Nashville.</p>

<p>The committee on the State and Judiciary, to whom was referred the
communication of the Auditor of public accounts, made the following
report, accompanied by sundry resolutions, all of which were read and
unanimously adopted.</p>

<p>To the Honorable the President and General Council of the Provisional
Government of Texas.</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the communication of the Au<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditor
of public accounts, (J. W. Moody,) respectfully report—</p>

<p>That upon examination of the resolution of November 11th, 1836,
they find it vague and ambiguous. By a strict and literal construction of
the resolution, no volunteers who were at the time of its passage in the
service of Texas, are entitled to the benefit of its provisions,, and those
who were embraced within its provisions, are entitled to twenty dollars
per month from the time they left their homes, until they returned, with<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
stipulating any time or any number of miles per day, by which their
mileage or allowance for travelling may be computed. But your com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mittee
are of opinion that to give the resolution the meaning it prima
facie imports, would not be construing it according to the object designed
by the House in its passage. It surely was the intention of the House
that all volunteers who entered the service at any time before, and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinued
in service until the capitulation of Bexar, and were honorably dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charged,
should be entitled to the benefits of the resolution; and that
some rates of mileage should be defined, and some time allowed and speci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied
after leaving their homes, until they enter the service, and for them to
return to their homes. In remedy whereof your committee advise the
adoption of the following resolutions:</p>

<p>Resolved, That the resolution of the Convention passed on the 11th
November, 1835, allowing certain pay to volunteers who were then in
the service of Texas, and should continue therein until the reduction of
Bexar, be extended to embrace all volunteers who joined the service as
aforesaid, at any time before the taking of Bexar, and continued therein
until its reduction, and were or may have been honorably discharged,
and the rates of computing mileage under said resolution shall be twenty

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

miles for each day allowed to be audited and settled as provided in other
cases of claims connected with the volunteer army aforesaid.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved. That all volunteers who turned out for the pur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pose
of aiding the citizen army before Bexar, upon the call made by the
Provisional Government, through their agents, appointed by resolutions
passed the 10th day of December, 1835, shall be entitled to the same
pay and allowance for mileage, going and returning, as is given and
allowed by the first section of those resolutions; and to be in the same
manner audited and settled.</p>

<p>Be it further resolved, That the Auditor shall be empowered, and he
is hereby empowered, when required by any claimant, or when in his
own opinion it may be necessary for doing justice, to call witnesses before
him, by subpoena, and on neglect or refusal of any witness to obey such
subpoena, to issue compulsory process, to bring such witness or wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nesses
before him, to give testimony on oath, which he is empowered to
administer, touching the matter under investigation; and if such wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness
or witnesses shall refuse to testify, he, she, or they, shall be fined,
in any sum not exceeding the amount claimed in the case wherein he,
she, or they are called to testify. And all and every Sheriff, deputy
Sheriff, or other ministerial officer of Texas, shall be compelled to exe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cute
any process issued and directed to them, or either of them, by the
Auditor relating to witnesses, under the same pains and penalties, in case
of refusal or neglect as could be inflicted, in case of refusal or neglect to
execute any process issued to him or them from any Court, Judge, or
other Judicial officer of Texas.</p>

<p>The committee on State and Judiciary, also, made the following re- .
port, which was read and adopted.</p>

<p>To the Honorable the President and General Council of the Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visional
Government of Texas.</p>

<p>Your committee to whom was referred the proceedings of the Court
of Enquiry, held in the town of Goliad, to investigate certain charges
preferred against Hugh McDonald Frazier, beg leave respectfully to re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port:
That they are at a loss to conjecture for what purpose the docu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
referred could have been sent to this Council, or what action it is
contemplated this House can have upon it. Can .it be expected that
this House is to pronounce upon the case there set forth? Proper tri<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bunals
have been created, both civil and military, whose province it is
to hear and determine these matters. True, it appears from the testi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mony
in the case, that Frazier’s conduct in regard to the plugs of tobacco,
&amp;c., is very reprehensible, but is it to be expected that this house is to
take cognizance of all petit larcenies and thefts, committed in the army
or elsewhere? If the House receive and consider communications of this
kind, and waste their time, so precious to the country, in its present em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />barrassments,
in giving countenance and ear to matters so totally foreign
to the objects of its organization, and so far without its sphere of action,
we cannot hope to meet the expectation of our constituents whose inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ests
we are appointed to guard.</p>

<p>Your committee with all deference and respect to this honorable body,
would further say, that they are equally at a loss to conceive what report
the House could have expected of them on the matter referred, or for
what purpose it was committed to them. Were the house to act on such
matters only, so far as they require acting upon, your committee are well

assured that they would be saved the labour of making report, and use<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less
expenditure of stationery (at this time in no great abundance here,)
upon them, and the House the fatigue of hearing these reports read.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Clements, the-report of the committee on military
affairs, and resolutions concerning the expedition to Matamoras, were
called up and read, and Mr. Hanks presented a letter from F. W. John<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son,
declining any participation in the contemplated expedition to Mata<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moras,
which was also read, and the House went into secret session, to
consider and act upon the same, whereupon the report and resolutions
together with the letter, aforesaid, were on motion of Mr. Royall, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />committed
to the committee on military affairs, and on motion of Mr.
Hanks, Mr. Barrett was added to the committee for this special case.
On motion of Mr. Royall, the secret session then. closed.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall the members of the Council were released
from any obligations of secrecy, in regard to the acts of the Council in
secret session, which appear upon the journal and record.</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and members of the Council:
Gentlemen—</hl></p>

<p>The preamble of the committee originating an ordinance and decree,,
authorising the purchase of certain armed vessels therein named, of
Messrs. McKinney and Williams, and for other purposes, &amp;c. I have
considered the same, with that attention which I considered the subject
merited, and have enclosed it back, with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>In the first place, our agents advise us, that they had purchased the
William Bobbins, and now have her in possession, and have changed
her name to that of Liberty, and that they have pledged the faith of
the country for payment, &amp;c.</p>

<p>They were certainly authorized to do so. It must be presumed that
their judgment was exercised in the purchase, and whether it be good
or bad, I consider your body has no right to interpose and counteract by
legislation, what they have done in conformity with their vested author<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ity.
And as it respects the purchase of the other armed vessel, called
the Invincible, the ordinance, as it now stands, leaves the matter entirely
open and dependent on contingent circumstances.—The holders might
not agree to take the price reported by our commissioners, for I consider
the matter left entirely open. If the commissioners report that the ves<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sel,
&amp;c., will answer as one of our naval vessels, in conformity with the
law creating the navy for Texas, and the holders are willing to take cost
and charges, let the contract be positive and binding on both parties:
Provided, the vessel be found to answer by our commissioners, and not
leave the matter open for bargain and sale after’the report is made. If
the commissioners report her as coming within the provisions of the:
law creating a navy for Texas, the contract should stand as closed: Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided,
the commissioners report her as coming within the purview of the
law. Otherwise, we have no authority to make the purchase. It cannot
be forgotten that our agents are specially instructed on that subject, and
if not immediately advised, will on their arrival in the United States,
employ agents to make the purchase. I consider the Council should not
breed confusion by infringing on the authority which they had already
vested in their agents.</p>

<p>I would suggest to your body, that from the activity and patriotism
of the holders, Messrs. McKinney and Williams, and their zeal, as has in
many cases been evinced, to serve the public, that I would be disposed to
take the report of Mr. McKinney, as soon as any other agent, which you
have or could appoint. And if from his report, you should find the ves<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sel
to come within the purview of the law, let the bargain be closed at
once, and our agents forthwith informed.—William P. Harris, collector
of the port of Galveston, could be immediately notified to receive her in
the name of the Government.</p>

<p>I therefore confidently hope that your honorable body will reconsider
the ordinance, and so alter and amend it, as to prevent conflict and in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jury.</p>

<p>I am respectfully</p>

<p>HENRY SMITH, Governor.</p>

<head>Council Hall, San Felipe de Austin,
<lb />January 9th, 1836.
<lb />NINE O’CLOCK, A. M.</head>

<p>The House met pursuant to adjournment.</p>

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceedings being read, Mr. McMullen, to
whom was referred the letter of M. Caldwell, made the following report;
which was read and adopted:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President and General Council of the Provis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ional Government of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on finance, to whom was referred the communication
of Mr. Caldwell of Gonzales, respectfully report, that they have examined
the same, and approve of the drafts drawn on the Government in favor
of Dennis and Miller, for two hundred and eighty-nine dollars forty cents,
and seventy-eight dollars ninety cents, but disapprove of the former
drafts being drawn at sight, as it was not in the power of Mr. Caldwell
to know what might be the state of the Treasury, or its ability to dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />charge
the draft on its presentation. Your committee would nevertheless
advise the allowance of said drafts, placing them on the same footing
with other claims against the Government.</p>

<p>In regard to the situation of the mill alluded to in said communica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
your committee reasonably infer from the lapse of time since the
writing of the communication, which is dated on the second of Decem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber,
that it has before this been repaired, so as to answer the grinding
necessities of the army at Gonzales, and therefore deem it unnecessary to
advise any course in relation thereto.</p>

<p>JOHN McMULLEN, Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker introduced resolutions in relation to John Gilbert’s wag<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gon,
team and harness, pressed and taken from said Gilbert by Mr. Grant;
and Mr. Clements offered an amendment; which was adopted; and on
motion of Mr. Hanks, they were ordered to lie on the table.</p>

<p>The President presented the auditor’s report; which on motion of
Mr. Barrett, was ordered to be filed.</p>

<p>The committee on military affairs, to whom was referred the account
of D. B. Friar, report, “that the accounts belong to some other commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee,
and not the military;” which report was read and adopted.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, chairman of the committee on the state and judiciary, to
whom was referred General Houston’s letters, in relation to the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of Sutler, made the following report; which was read and adopted.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the General Council of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on state affairs and judiciary, to whom was referred
the letter of General Sam Houston, for regulating the appointment and
duties of Sutler, &amp;c., report, that the importance of having sutlers regu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />larly
appointed for supplying the army with such articles, as are wanted
and often unprovided by Government, under army arrangements, has too
long been admitted and practised, to require proofs or admit of doubts.</p>

<p>In the organization of the armies of Texas, this department of the ser<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice
was no doubt contemplated, although not expressly provided for.
In as much as the Sutler provides from his own capital, there can arise
no pecuniary responsibilities to the Government, and the only require<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments

the probability of any inconvenience arising in consequence of a de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pendence
upon this source for the purchase of such articles, as are usually

<p>Your committee therefore advise the adoption of the following resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions:</p>

<p>Be it resolved, that There shall be a Sutler appointed for the armies of

be regulated and governed by the same rules and principles, as
govern and regulate the practice in this department in the United States
of the North.</p>

<p>Be it resolved, that there shall be one Sutler appointed for the armies
of Texas, whose duties shall be regulated upon the rules and practice as
directed in resolution first: Provided, that that the said Sutler shall have
power to appoint Sutlers to act under him at such points as the Gover<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nor
or commanding General shall direct, and for the faithful perform<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ance

<p>And being informed that you do not meet today, I must beg the favor

may perhaps consider my communication severe. I wish you however
to permit it to be read; I assure you it is necessary. I wish you to dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinctly

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable the President and members of the General Council.</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>I herewith transmit to your body, the returns and correspondence of
Colonel Neill, Lieutenant Colonel Commandant of the-post at Bexar.</p>

<p>You will in that correspondence find the situation of that Garrison.
You will find there a detail of facts, calculated to call forth the indignant
feelings of every honest man. Can your body say that they have not
been cognizant of and connived at this predatory expedition? Are you
not daily holding conference and planning co-operation both by sea and
land? Acts speak louder than words, they are now before me, authoriz<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
a Generalissimo with plenary powers, to plan expeditions on the
faith, the credit, and I may justly say, to the ruin of the country. You

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

urge me by resolutions to make appointments, fit out vessels, as govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
vessels, registering them as such, appointing landsmen to command
a naval expedition by making representations urgent in their nature, and
for what? I see no reason but to carry into effect by the hurried and im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />provident
acts of my department, the views of your favorite object by
getting my sanction to an act discouraging in its nature, and ruinous in
its effects. Instead of acting as becomes the counsellors and guardians
of a free people; you resolve yourselves into low, intriguing, caucussing
parties, pass resolutions without a quorum, predicated on false premises,
and endeavor to ruin the country, by countenancing, aiding and abetting
marauding parties, and if you could only deceive me enough, you would
join with it a piratical co-operation. You have acted in bad faith, and
seem determined by your acts to destroy the very institutions which you
are pledged and sworn to support. I have been placed on the political
watch tower, I feel the weight of responsibility devolving upon me, and
■confidently hope I will be able to prove a faithful sentinel. You have
also been posted as sentinels, but you have permitted the enemy to pass
your lines, and Mexican like, you are ready to sacrifice your country at
the shrine of plunder. Mr. President, I speak collectively as you all
form one whole, though at the same time I do not mean all. I know you
have honest men there, and of sterling worth and integrity; but you hav e
Judas in the camp—corruption, base corruption has crept into your
councils, men, who if possible would deceive their God.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their deep laid plans and intrigues, I have not been
asleep; they have long been anticipated, forestalled and counteracted.
They will find themselves circumvented on every tack. I am now tired
of watching scoundrels abroad and scoundrels at home, and as such I
.am now prepared to drop the curtain. The appointment and instruc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
founded on the resolutions predicated on false premises, shall now
be tested. I will immediately countermand the order made out in such
haste, and as you say, and as her register says, the armed vessel Invinci<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ble
is a Government vessel, I will immediately order a suitable officer of
the Government to go and take charge of her in the name of the Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernment,
and hold her subject to my order. And if that be refused, I
will immediately recall her register by proclamation to the world. I
would further suggest to you that our 'foreign agents have been com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missioned
and specially instructed to fill out our navy, and procure the
proper officers and crews; and unless they can be certainly informed of
the absolute purchase in time, to prevent their purchase of a similar one,
the purchase, so made by you, shall never be ratified or become binding
on this government; because you would do the Government serious in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />jury
by meddling with matters which you have put out of your power
by special appointment. You shall not be permitted by collusion or man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />agement,
to act in bad faith to the injury of the Government. If the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointment
of general agents, with latitudinarian powers, with the power
of substitution, and many other things equally inconsistent, and ridicu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lous;
which have been engendered in, and emanated from your caucus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sing,
intriguing body, recently, does not show, a want of respect to my
department, and a total neglect of the sacred oaths and pledges solemnly
made by you, I must admit I am no judge. I wish you distinctly to un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />derstand,
that the ground on which you stand is holy. and shall be
guarded and protected with every assiduity on my part. Permit me

<pb ed="unknown" n="213" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

again to repeat it, Mr. President, that it is not intended to touch either
yourself or the honest and well intending part of your Council.</p>

<p>Look around upon your flock, your discernment will easily detect the
scoundrels. The complaint; contraction of the eyes; the gape of the
mouth; the vacant stare; the hung head; the restless fidgety disposition;
the sneaking sycophantic look; a natural meanness of countenance; an
unguarded shrug of the shoulders; a sympathetic tickling and contrac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the muscles of the neck anticipating the rope; a restless uneasi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness
to adjourn, dreading to face the storm themselves have raised.</p>

<p>Let the honest and indignant part of your Council drive the wolves
out of the fold; for by low intrigue and management they have been im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed
upon, and duped into gross error and palpable absurdities. Some
of them have been thrown out of folds equally sacred, and should be
denied the society of civilized man.</p>

<p>They are paricides piercing their. devoted country, already bleeding
at every pore. But thanks be to my God, there is balm in Texas and a
physician near. Our agents have gone abroad; our army has been or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganized.
Our general is in the field. A convention has been called
which will afford a sovereign remedy to the vile machinations of a cau<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cussing,
intriguing and-corrupt Council. I now tell you that the course
here pointed out, shall be rigidly and strictly pursued, and that unless
your body will make the necessary acknowledgment to the world, of your
error, and forthwith proceed, and with the same facility and publicity,
(by issuing a circular,) and furnishing expresses to give circulation and
publicity, in a manner calculated to counteract its baleful effects, that
after twelve o’clock to-morrow all communications between the two de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />partments
shall cease; and your body will stand adjourned until the first
of March next, unless from the emergencies of the country you should
be convened by proclamation at an earlier period.</p>

<p>I consider as the devisers of ways and means, you have done all con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />templated
by the organic law. That your services are now no longer
needed, until the convention meets; I will continue to discharge my
duties as Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy, and see that the
laws are executed.</p>

<p>The foregoing you will receive as a notice from my department, which
will be rigidly carried into effect. You are further notified that audi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ence
will not be given to any member or special committee other than
in writing. I will immediately proceed to publish all the correspondence
had between the two departments by proclamation to the world, and
assign the reasons why I have pursued this course, and the causes which
have impelled me to do it.</p>

so miserably deceived in selecting for the high office of Governor, a man
whose language and conduct prove his early habits of association to have<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />been
vulgar and depraved, and his present disposition, that of a tyrant.
That they repel the infamous charges preferred against this Council and
its members, as false and unfounded in every part; and-contemn the style
and language as low, blackguardly and vindictive, and every way un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />worthy
of, and disgraceful to the office whence it emanated, and as an

<head>TO THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS.</head>

<p>When, in the execution of delegated powers, the representatives of a
Sovereign People are urged to the necessity of adopting harsh means, to
protect the interests of their country, and save her from anarchy, it be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />comes
their duty to their constituents to explain to them the- circum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stances
under which they have acted, and the inefficacy of a milder
course. Under these considerations, and a full sense of the high respon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sibility
resting upon them, the representatives of the people of Texas, in
General Council assembled, chosen and delegated to guard her rights'
and interests, in her present embarrassed and critical situation, are pain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
compelled to disclose to their constituents and to' the world, oc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />currences
as unlooked for, as they are to be deplored and regretted. In
a government like ours, formed for the present emergencies, hastily or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganized,
and at' a time when confusion and disorder prevailed through<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />out
our oppressed land, it could not be expected that perfect harmony
and concord would characterize all the acts of all its departments, or en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tire
satisfaction could be given by all its legislations; but it was at least
to have been hoped, and the hope was fondly cherished by the members
of this Council, as well as by all patriots, that, by mutual compromises
and a general spirit of concession, the present necessities of our beloved
country could be answered. All immediate self-interest we endeavored
to discard; all private ambition and individual jealousies to sacrifice on
the altar of our country, and to unite in fraternal Council to promote and
advance the general weal. That this department of the government has
so far succeeded in their adherence to these principles, we appeal to our

<pb n="765" xml:id="P0765" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/773/" />

public acts, and to all who have witnessed our deliberations. When com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plaints
have been made to us, of our acts, we have endeavored calmly
and considerately to revise our conduct, and correct, so far as we are
•able, all errors and inconsistencies. With the other department of the'
Provisional Government, we have endeavored to co-operate in the same<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spirit
of concession, and allowance for all errors and misconceptions, and
to avert the present lamentable state of affairs, has been our constant and
unremitting care: but, unfortunately for the country, it was not to be
prevented. From the very organization of the government we have wit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nessed
with the deepest regret, and most painful apprehensions, the dis- ■
position of that department to abridge the powers of the General Council, .
which were designed as a check upon executive usurpation, and to as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sume
to itself the provinces of both departments. The executive has
from time to time, communicated his advice to the Council, which it has •
always received with that deference due to the Office from which it came,
and has maturely weighed and deliberated upon the same, but when the
Council has adopted the measures recommended by him in his message,
he has withheld or delayed his signature to their ordinances, or neglected
to comply with their requisitions; and at other times he has transcended
all authority, violating the organic law, framed and enacted by the peo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ple’s
own immediate representatives, in General Council assembled, and
the republican principles of the constitution of Mexico of 1824, which'
he is solemnly sworn to support; and has imputed to the Council the
evils resulting from his own acts. He has assumed the right of appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
and commissioning, and has so appointed and commissioned, private
individuals to take the command. of armies, without the consent or advice
of the Council, and in direct violation and contradiction of the organic
law of the convention, to which he owes his official existence.</p>

<p>After the reduction of Bexar, the volunteer troops being idle within
our boundary, numbers daily coming in to our assistance from the
United States of the North, and the country not affording the means
of supporting them, it was thought advisable by the Council and the
Governor so advised them, to keep the war without our territories, and to
have the volunteers actively and profitably employed. For that purpose
the Council authorized Colonel J. W. Fannin to enlist volunteers, hold
an election of officers; and the army when raised and organized, to make
a descent upon Matamoras, specifying the manner, and prescribing the
limits of Colonel Fannin’s actions as the agent of the Government for
that special purpose; for which they received from the Governor the
vilest and most uncouth anathema, couched in the most vulgarly abusive
language, charging them with appointing a generalissimo with plenary
powers, to conduct a plundering and marauding expedition, and wishing
to join with it a piratical co-operation; while he himself without the ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vice,
consent, or knowledge of the Council, and plainly and palpably in.
violation of the organic law, which he is unequivocally sworn to obey,
had just given to James Bowie, not known to the government as an
officer of any rank whatever, orders, through the Commander-in-Chief,
to raise an army and proceed against Matamoras; thus endeavouring by
misrepresentations and false charges against the Council, to excite public
indignation against them, and divert if possible, their attention from his
own lawless and headlong course, trampling law under his feet disregard<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
his official oath, and breaking up the foundations of Government.</p>

<pb n="766" xml:id="P0766" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/774/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="218" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

<p>He charges the Council with joining with the expedition against Mata<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moras,
a piratical co-operation. By this he means the purchase of the
schooner Invincible, by the appointing of Thomas F. McKinney, (whose
patriotism he highly commends in his message to the Council,) to the
command, for the purpose of attacking and taking, if practicable, the
Montezuma, a Mexican vessel, now in Galveston, which has been cruising
about our coasts, to annoy and capture vessels coming into our ports, and
intercept the importation into Texas of men, munitions of war, and sup<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plies
for our armies. It was for the purpose of capturing if possible,
this vessel, and for the further purpose of protecting our commerce and
obstructing that of the enemy, that the Council authorized the purchase
and equipment for service, of the schooner Invincible; a measure recom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mended
by Governor Smith, in his communications to the Council.</p>

<p>All these acts of stubbornness and perverseness, were not sufficient to
gratify his thirst for the sole dominion and arbitrary sway of the land.
His dignity was insulted at the idea of the existence of the co-ordinate
branch of the Government, to curb his acts and check his usurpation.
He became more and more restless, until enraged at the presumption of
the Council, in the exercise of a constitutional right, and in conformity
with the true interests of the country, to pass an ordinance and decree
by a constitutional majority, after it had been vetoed by “his Excel<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lency/’
he ignites; his fury in a blaze, consumes his prudence, (what he
had) he orders the Council to disperse, shuts'the doors of communica<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
between the two departments, and proclaims himself the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment!</p>

<p>Such is the purport of his last message, dated the ninth of January
instant, accompanied with documents received by express from Bexar,
containing an account of the deplorable situation in which the troops of
that garrison were left by Dr. Grant, who headed an expedition from
that place to Matamoras. The message he would make it appear, was in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />duced
by the arrival of these dispatches, as he directed them to be read
first as an induction to his message, in which he falsely charges the
Council with having connived at, and sanctions the expedition under Dr.
Grant, which he alleges, is the cause of the distressed situation of the
troops at Bexar. This Council repels the charges, as false and un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />founded,
and denies having ever recognized in Dr. Grant any authority
whatever, as an officer of the Government or army at the time. The only
authority Dr. Grant ever had in the army was derived from Governor
Smith. By the bye, this gives us occasion to mention another of the
Governor’s acts of usurpation.</p>

<p>On or about the ninth day of December, 1835, he appoints and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missions,
without the advice or consent of the Council, Edward Burleson,
Commander-in-Chief of the volunteer army at Bexar. General Burleson
appoints Dr. Grant, his aid-de camp, who was thereby entitled to rank
as Colonel, and thus is derived his authority to act as he has done.
In this letter of the Governor to General Burleson, dated December
9th, 1835, full of invectives against Colonel Gonzales, and his men, and
the Council for furnishing him an outfit to assist in the reduction of that
place, (for all of which we only call his attention to his solemn declara<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
to the world, and appeal to Almighty God, made in the Conven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,)
he shows the principles which controlled his conduct, and the
effect of his elevation to the high office he now occupies, has produced

<pb ed="unknown" n="219" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

upon him, and explains the reason of all the difficulties that have oc<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curred
between the two departments, as well, perhaps, as anything to
which the attention of the people can be called. Thus he concludes his
letter to General Burleson—“You will use the. following address: To
his Excellency, Henry Smith, Governor of Texas.”</p>

<p>Take this and compare it with that impudential document, sent by
him to disgrace the archives of your Council, his message, dated the ninth
instant, it may serve to explain. Read the message of his Excellency;
.after accusing the Council of resolving themselves into “low intriguing
caucussing parties,” for the injury of the Government, and charging
them with divers evils, which we have proved, resulted from his own acts,
..and exculpating the President of the Council, he proceeds.”</p>

<p>“Look round upon your flock; your discernment will easily detect the
scoundrels. The complaints, contraction of the eyes, the gape of the
mouth, the vacant stare, the hung head, the restless fidgety disposition,
the sneaking sycophantic look, a natural meanness of countenance, an
unguarded shrug of the shoulders, a sympathetic tickling and contraction
of the muscles of the neck, anticipating the rope, a restless uneasiness to
adjourn, dreading to face the storm themselves have raised.”</p>

<p>This is the language of the Governor in his official document in rela<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
to the chosen delegates of a free people; but let us proceed with this
singular production of his Excellency.</p>

<p>“I now tell you that the course here pointed out shall be rigidly and
.strictly pursued, and that unless your body will make the necessary ac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />knowledgment
to the world of your error, and forthwith proceed, and
with the same facility and publicity, (by issuing a circular, and furnishing
•expresses,) to give circulation and publicity in a manner calculated to
counteract its baleful effects, that after twelve o’clock to-morrow, all
communication between the two departments shall cease, and your body
will stand adjourned until the first of March next, unless, from the emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gencies
of the case, you shall be convened by proclamation, at an earlier
period.”</p>

<p>Again he concludes by saying, “you are further notified that audience
will not be given to any member or special committee, other than in
writing.” This is the document sent to the representatives of the free
and sovereign people of Texas, by his Excellency, Henry Smith, Gov<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ernor.</p>

<p>We appeal to a civilized world, to know if its equal was ever issued
from an officer of such dignity, as that of a Governor of a State. By what
sort of delusion could he have been so blindly actuated, as to put forth
a document so degrading to himself, so mortifying to his countrymen
and disgraceful to the office he holds! Could his success in imposing
himself upon the people as their Governor, encourage him to attempt
the assumption of all the power, authority and dominion he now claims?
Heaven forgive his delusion! And may he learn from this act, that a
gallant people, engaged in a perilous contest for right, with a foreign
foe, cannot be thus gulled and cheated of their liberties at home, under
the immediate superintendence of their agents.</p>

<p>The Council met the occasion with all the calmness and. deliberation
they could muster. They endeavored to devise means to prevent this
confusion in the departments of Government; for the credit of their
country they sought to avert it. Personal feelings and consideration

were abandoned. But the time had arrived when all communication was
to cease between the departments, unless they would surrender to him
the entire government, perjure themselves, and publish their perjury to
the world, and swear that they had betrayed the interests of their coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trymen,
in not yielding implicit obedience to the will of Governor Smith.
What could the Council do? He had shut the door of his office; it was, in
effect, vacant: Ele had denied the authority that created it; and as the
guardians of the people’s interests, they were compelled to proceed with
the transaction of business, recognizing, according to law, the Lieutenant<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />Governor,
as the acting Governor; elected a President of their body pro
tem.; and as in duty bound, they have preferred charges of impeachment
against Governor Smith, for the manifest injuries and difficulties he has
endeavored to bring upon his country; that country which raised him to
the high and responsible station of her Governor. Yes, the Council met
the occasion firmly.</p>

<p>Base perjury would have stamped her seal upon their acts, if they had
flinched. And while the armies are abroad in the defence of our be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />loved
land, from the invasion of a foreign foe, they will ever guard and
protect her from the insidious machinations of her internal foes, and will
deserve the just condemnation and lasting reproach of their countrymen,
if ever in danger, they desert their post.</p>

<p>Spec. 3d. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
did on the evening of the tenth day of January, instant, stte that
he had been for the last two weeks constantly employed in counteracting
the proceedings of the General Council, and that the dissolution of the
Council would be right, and not productive of injury, which declaration,
he also continues in his communication, read before the Council, on the
same day.</p>

<p>Spec. 4. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
without the advice, authority or consent of the General Council,
did on or about the ninth day of December, ultimo, extend commissions
to the following private individuals, viz: names in the possession of the

<head>CHARGE FOURTH.</head>

<p>SPECIFICATTON 1st. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Gover<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nor
as aforesaid, has been guilty of a gross libel upon the Council as a
body, in his communication dated January 9th, 1836, by charging the
Council with resolving itself into low, intriguing, caucussing parties;
passing resolutions without a quorum, predicated upon false premises;
that he falsely and maliciously charges the Council with endeavoring
to ruin the country, by countenancing, aiding and abetting marauding
parties, and by attempting to join with it a piratical co-operation; by
charging the Council with violating their official pledges and oath; by

<pb ed="unknown" n="223" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

charging them with a desire to sacrifice their country at the shrine of
plunder; by charging the Council with corruption and deception; by
using towards them foul and scurrilous language, and vile epithets, call<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
members scoundrels and parricides, and descending to low ridicule
of natural infirmities of individual members, and for many other false,
malicious and libellous charges against said Council contained in the
aforesaid communication.</p>

<p>Spec. 2d. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
in the same communication referred to in specification first, under
charge fourth, has been guilty of grossly libelling individual members,
in language degrading to his official station, and thereby endeavoring to
bring individual members into ridicule and contempt.</p>

<p>Spec. 3d. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
did, in the presence of one of the members of the General Council
and other citizens present, utter and publish slander of individual mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bers,
and of the Council generally, originating in vindictive malice,
caused by the Council’s exercising their constitutional right of pass<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
into ordinances, acts which he had given an executive veto, at the
same time declaring his determination of introducing schisms into the
Council.</p>

<p>Spec. 4th. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
through the medium of spies and tale bearers, and by low intriguing
management with such description of persons, seeks to procure informa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the proceedings and opinions of the Council and of its members,
endeavoring to pry into the sanctity of its secret sessions, which he him<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />self
recommends, and listens to false and malicious misrepresentations,
such as are to be expected from the class of persons who would be em<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ployed
for such vile purposes.</p>

<p>Spec. 5th. That the said. Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
shows his official inconsistency and mismanagement; First, by his
communication of the -------- day of January, when he commends the
patriotism of McKinney and Williams, and after appointing the same
Mr. McKinney to take charge of the Government vessel, he in a com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />munication
dated January the ninth, calls the same Mr. McKinney a
deceiver and a land pirate. Second, he strongly recommended the Com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manding-G
eneral to treat with the Cherokee Indians of the east, in a
few days afterwards, orders him several hundred miles to the "west; he
recommended the purchase of the vessel of McKinney and Williams,
which is now offered to the Government, when a member of the commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee
of safety of Columbia, and now endeavors to embarrass and defeat
the execution of the same contract.</p>

<p>Spec. 6th. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
manifested his contempt of the powers and authority of the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Council by appointing officers without the consent of the General
Council, as set forth in specification second, third and fourth under
charge the third.</p>

<p>Spec. 7th. That the said Henry Smith, Provisional Governor as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said,
neglected and refused to instruct the commissioners treating -with
the Cherokee Indians, agreeably to the resolutions of the General Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil.
He usurped the rights of the Council in transcending his authority
for giving instructions, especially to procure the proper officers for the
navy. He exercises the Executive veto, to gratify private malice, and

without regard to reason, truth or consistency, with manifest disposition
to exercise dictatorial powers over the representatives of the people. He
has by his communication of the ninth of January instant, attempted to
dissolve the Provisional Government of Texas, by endeavoring to alarm
them with proclamations, interdicting communications between the De<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />partments
of Government, and declaring the General Council adjourned
until the first of March next, unless the representatives of the Sovereign
People would yield to humiliating concessions and conditions dictated
by himself, and yield themselves the slaves of his will and pleasure.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Royall,</p>

<p>Resolved, That the address to the people of Texas be signed by all the
officers and members of the General Council.</p>

<p>The following communication was received from Henry Smith, which
was read and referred to a committee consisting of Messrs. Clements and
Rovall.</p>

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT of Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and Members of the Legislative
Council:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen:—</p>

<p>The communication sent to your body on the tenth inst., in which
I used much asperity of language, which I considered at the time was
called for from me: owing to what I deemed improvident acts of your
body, in which I considered much intrigue and duplicity had been used,
which was in their nature and tendency calculated to breed confusion
and greatly injure the public good. Among other things the appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of Colonel Fannin, was one which I deemed unwarranted by law
and of injurious tendency. If the act of your body was ratified by me,
it is plain and evident, that neither the Commander-in-Chief, the Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil,
nor the Executive, could have any control over him. I therefore
deemed it a gross insult offered by the Council to my Department, and
one which I was not willing to overlook. I admit that I repelled it with
a keenness and asperity of language beyond the rules of decorum; be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cause
I believed it was certainly intended as an insult direct. If there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
your body should think proper to acknowledge their error by an
immediate correction of it, which I consider would only be their reason<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />able
duty, all differences between the two Departments should cease;
and so far as I am concerned be forever buried in oblivion. And that
friendly and harmonious intercourse resumed which should ever exist
between the different branches of the Government. I suggest and solicit
this from the purest motives, believing the public good would thereby be
advanced. Believing that the rules of Christian charity require. of us to
bear and forbear, and as far as possible to overlook the errors and foibles
of each other. In this case I may not have exercised towards your body
that degree of forbearance which was probably your due. If so, I have
been laboring under error, and as such hope, you will have the magna<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nimity

and the circumstances which compel them to adopt this course.</p>

<p>Resolved, That the communication alluded to be returned together
with a copy of the charges and specifications preferred against the said
Henry Smith, late Governor aforesaid, for malfeasance and misconduct
in office, and that he be notified to reply within three days, or that the

<head>Executive DEPARTMENT OF Texas.</head>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable President and members of the Council.</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN:—</p>

<p>On the ninth instant I notified your body that as the devisors uf ways
and means, I considered you had performed all the duties incumbent on
you, contemplated by the organic law, and as such, I consider the country
would be relieved from a heavy tax by your adjournment until the first
of March. And if in the interim anv emergency should render it neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary,
that you could immediately be called by proclamation. On the
tenth I received notice that I was removed from office. Not by death,
inability or other casualty, but for exercising too much capacity; and
that by virtue of authoritv vested in vour body; that you had installed a
new Governor; and had created a new organization. After formally

<pb ed="unknown" n="228" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

breaking me you have been good enough to summon me to a formal trial,
leaving the alternative with myself to choose the tribunal before whom I
would be tried, whether before your own body, before whom I had al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ready
been condemned, or before my peers in convention. Reason, it
would seem, would direct the latter alternative. I at all times hold- my<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />self
answerable and amenable as a public officer to my peers, and to none
other. I acknowledge the receipt of the charges and specifications pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
against me by your body, and feel able and willing in convention
to plead to them. Reserving to myself in the mean time the privilege of
taking all legal exceptions. I demand of your president as a right, the
names of all the members present on the ninth-instant, with the proper
certificate, commencing with the first of the present month, and up to
the present date inclusive. And all the members now present are noti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied,
to appear at the town of Washington, as witnesses, on the first day
of March next, for by your own acts and the proof of your own body, I
hope to be able to exculpate myself before a liberal and unbiassed body
from all the charges preferred against me. It would appear that some
jurisdictions are not represented, others have two and some long since
precluded by law seem to hold on, and form a part of your body. I think
it would be well to examine these things, as circumstances may render its
investigation necessary.</p>

<p>I would give your body this friendly advice, that notwithstanding you
are the representatives of the people, they have given you the limit, over
which they will not permit you to pass, and any thing done by your body
calculated to bring about disorganization, or not warranted by the organic
law, will be viewed and considered as an outrage for which you will be
held amenable.</p>

<p>What I have done, however bad you may view it, has been done for the
best of reasons, and from the purest motives. I care not for popularity,
and seek alone the public good. And if the course I have persued, so con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />demned
by you, should bring down the odium and contempt of the whole
community, and at the same time be the means of saving the character,
the credit, and finally redeem the country, I say to you, in the sincerity
of truth, that it is a sacrifice I willingly make at the shrine of the public
good.</p>

connected with the recent disclosure to this House, of executive acts
heretofore kept from their knowledge, places the expedition got up for a
descent upon Matamoras by the volunteers at Bexar, in a point of view,,
widely different from that which was first presented to them, with the
knowledge of facts then acted upon. The strong objections of the
Governor to the movement of the volunteers, as represented in Col.
Johnson’s first communication to this Council, induced the apprehen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sion
that all was not right. But upon a further knowledge of facts, it
appears that the measure as adopted by Col. Johnson, arose from an
apparent legal authority from the Provisional Government, and which
this Council, will not, at this time disclaim, as they would have a right
to do.</p>

<p>Edward Burleson being commissioned by the Governor, without the
knowledge of the General Council, General and commander-in-chief of
the volunteer army before Bexar, as such had the right of appointing.'
his staff with the rank of colonels. This situation and rank were con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />f
erred upon, F. W. Johnson and James Grant, as appears by evidence
known to your committee. On leaving Bexar, General Burleson left
Col. Johnson in command, he also having succeeded to the command
in Bexar, on the death of Colonel Milam, during the storming of that
place. An expedition against Matamoras was called for, by sound policy,
the voice of the people, and the opinion of most members of the General
Council. The commanding general, Burleson, was advised to pursue
that measure by members of the General Council; and on the command
devolving upon Colonel Johnson, his situation required him to act, upon
the orders he had received, directed to General Burleson. The call was
made for volunteers for the expedition, and-a plan of operation con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />certed.
Col. Johnson, like a true patriot, presented the whole to the
Governor, and laid the same before the General Council and although,
some misconception of rights, had arisen among the volunteers, from
the want of a proper knowledge of the existing laws upon the army
organization, yet no material obstacles would have arisen to stop or
embarras the expedition, as planned, had the preceding facts been earlier

men.</p>

<p>Your committee cannot advise a departure from the .laws adopted by
the Government regulating the volunteer service. General rules
must be respected. But no consequences can possibly arise affect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the rights of volunteers as contemplated by the seventh section of an
ordinance and decree, creating and organizing an auxiliary corps for
Texas, which would not follow the plan proposed by Col. Johnson.
These volunteers are willing to go out under the authority of the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
but incline to prescribe the manner; which cannot be admitted
without violating existing laws. This, reason, sound policy, and good
faith to other volunteers forbid. And yet the difference is quite im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />material
in effect; for in either ease the volunteers are, or may be under
the direct orders of the Governor and Council, equally at the election of
themselves through their officers.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore advise that Colonel Johnson have the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />probation
of this Government to conduct the volunteers who have en<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tered
upon the expedition to Matamoras, as the officers of the Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment,
arising from the commission of the Governor to General Burleson,

and the succession to the command of Bexar under his orders; and that
he proceed to unite with J. W. Fannin, the government agent, appointed
by resolutions of this House, duly passed and adopted. And that when
said volunteers are all concentrated as directed by the resolutions ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointing
J. AV. Fannin, agent, &amp;c., a commander of the whole body be
elected under the existing laws. Before which juncture, Col. Johnson
should be authorized to hold an election by the volunteers from Bexar,
of all the requisite officers, and have the same properly certified and
reported to the General Council. And also that an election in the same
manner be had, by J. AV. Fannin, of the other volunteers, when as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sembled
and in like manner reported. And that all the candidates so
certified, as elected, shall be forthwith commissioned agreeably to law.
And that as soon as the election is over, the proper reports for operation
be made, and every action and movement made, with the same powers
and authority as if commissions were extended, with the pledge of this
government to sustain said volunteers, in all acts which they could
legally do, if their commissions were perfected.</p>

<p>Whereupon the following resolution is offered to the consideration, of
the House with the view of carrying the objects of the foregoing report
into effect.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the foregoing report be adopted by this House, as the
rule of action prescribed as there set forth, and that a copy thereof, duly
certified, be delivered to Colonel F. W. Johnson, and another so certi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fied,
sent to Col. J. W. Fannin, and that the enforcement of its objects,
will be required, in manner and form as therein expressed, in the same
manner as if the same were reduced to and passed as. a decree of the
Provisonal Government.</p>

<p>Resolved, that nothing contained in the foregoing report and resolu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
shall be so taken, as to interfere with the agency granted to J. AV.
Fannin by the Provisional Government heretofore.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, chairman of the committee on state and judiciary, made
the following report on C. B. Stewart’s communication; which was read
and adopted.</p>

<p>An ordinance and decree, confirming the appointment of C. B. Stew<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />art,
as Secretary of the Executive, and for other purposes.</p>

<p>Whereas, doubts have arisen as to the regularity of the appointment
of C. B. Stewart, as Secretary of the Executive, Recorder, &amp;c., under
and by virtue of an ordinance and decree of the Provisional Government,
passed, November 24th, 1835, entitled "an ordinance and decree for
appointing a Treasurer, &amp;c.,” and whereas the legality of his notarial
acts, as-such Secretary, are also doubted; to guard against all possibility
of uncertainty in the premises.</p>

<p>Section 1st. Be it ordained and decreed, and it is hereby ordained
and decreed, by the General Council of the Provisional Government of
Texas, that the appointment of Charles B. Stewart as Secretary of the
Executive and Recorder, &amp;c., made by the General Council, on the nine<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />teenth
day of November, 1835, be and the same is hereby confirmed,
and all the acts of the said C. B. Stewart, as such Secretary and Recorder,
made in conformity with the law under which he has acted, are hereby
declared to be legal, and forever confirmed, to all intents and purposes,
as if there had existed no doubts, as to the regularity of his said appoint<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment.</p>

<p>Sec. 2d. Be it further ordained and decreed, and it is hereby ordained
and decreed by the authority aforesaid, that the notarial acts and ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministration
of oaths, done by the aforesaid Secretary and Recorder,
connected with the duties and business of his said office be, and the
same are hereby declared legal and valid in law, in as full and ample
manner, and to have the same effect, as if these powers had been es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pecially
defined before his said appointment, by the law creating the
said office. And also, that the Secretary of the Executive, shall forever
hereafter, have full power and authority to do and execute all notarial
acts, and administer oaths in all cases growing out of, or necessarily
connected with, the duties of the said office.</p>

<p>Sec. 3. Be it further ordained and decreed, that the Governor, Lieu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tenant
Governor, President of the General Council, Secretary of the
Council, and all Judge Advocates of the army be, and they are hereby
vested with full power and authority to administer oaths in all matters

<p>The President presented a letter from C. B. Stewart, Executive Sec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />retary;
which was read and referred to the committee on state and ju<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />diciary.</p>

<p>Also, a letter from M. Caldwell; which was read and referred to the
committee on military affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from the committee on military affairs, to whom was re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
the communications of M. Caldwell, of the 9th December, 1835,
presented the following report; which was adopted.</p>

<p>Your committee, to whom was referred the report of M. Caldwell, beg
leave to state to. the House, that in the opinion of your committee no
action can be had upon it for the following reasons:</p>

<p>Mr. Caldwell is not known to this House as a contractor, and if he has
been appointed sub-contractor, it is his duty to settle with the individual
who appointed him, and let that individual present his report; that is,
the contractor who appointed him.</p>

<p>Your committee beg leave hence to be discharged from the further
consideration of the report.</p>

<p>Mr. Clements, from the committee on Indian affairs, to. whom was
referred the letter of D. B. Friar, obtained leave to have the same trans<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ferred
to the committee on military affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Cullen, presented and read a message from James W. Robinson,
the acting Governor, together with divers letters and documents accom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />panying
the same, all of which were referred to the several standing
committees of the House.</p>

<p>And on motion of Mr. Clements, ordered that a copy of the message
be sent to the public printer for publication.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President and Members of the General Council:</hl></p>

<p>Gentlemen—</p>

<p>In obedience to the resolution of your honorable body, unanimously
adopted on the tenth instant, declaring the office of Governor vacant,
and requiring me to enter upon the discharge of the duties of the same,
according to the provisions of the second article of the organic law, cre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ating
a Provisional Government for Texas. I obey the painful and un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />expected
call of your honorable body, and enter upon the discharge of

<pb n="781" xml:id="P0781" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/789/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="233" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

my official duties, with a firm reliance upon divine Providence, and your
wisdom and experience to direct and assist me in the performance of that
highly important trust; and I cherish the devout hope, that your labors
to improve, save, and serve the country, may be crowned with success.</p>

<p>In doing so, permit me to assure you, that no consideration but the
safety and happiness of the country, could induce me to accept the office
of Governor, at this time, and under the peculiar and delicate relations
existing between the General Council and myself, and the Ex-Governor
of Texas, Henry Smith, Esq., with the latter of whom, the utmost good
feeling has uniformly prevailed; and had the honor of presiding over
your deliberations by virtue of my appointment of Lieutenant Governor,
by the General Convention of the chosen delegates of all Texas; and
having received the personal kindness of the members of your honorable
body, I was unwilling to separate from you, or change the relation that
already existed between us: but circumstances beyond my power to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trol,
or within your authority to prevent, have imposed the deplorable
necessity upon me, of accepting the responsible station to which, as the
immediate representatives of the people, you have called me. I neither
seek nor avoid responsibility; it is the duty of every citizen to obey the
call of his country, and upon that principle, it becomes my duty to bow
in submission.</p>

<p>The assumption of power, claimed by the Ex-Governor, in his mess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />age
of the tenth instant, is of a most extraordinary character, dangerous
in its tendency, calculated to wither the laurels of the hero, blight with
a fatal mildew the fondest hopes of the patriot, and crush forever the
heroic efforts of the freeman of Texas, now grapling in deadly conflict,
with the military usurper of Mexico, and are such as I confidently hope
will meet the just indignation of an enlightened community; for in
times like these, every direct and bold attack and invasion of the rights
of the people, ought to be promptly repelled. Let it not with truth
be said, that after having bearded the lion in his den, and driven him
from it in confusion and dismay, that we tamely suffer the wolf, in
sheep’s clothing, to enter the fold and destroy the flock.</p>

<p>The encroachments of executive power and patronage, upon the rights
and privileges of the co-ordinate branches of the Government in Europe
and America, have formed the ground of complaint on the part of the
revolutionists in most, if not all cases, and in the incipient stage of our
Government, we ought to stop the inroad of this hydra monster of politi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cal
wickedness, before it has time or opportunity to establish itself by
precedent and immemorial usage, and thereby silently undermine the
temple of freedom dedicated to the people, before the workmen have
completed the edifice. 'But you are told in the message, that it is the
duty of the Executive; nay, imperious necessity compels him. The
Tyrant’s plea!</p>

<p>So said Alexander, when he hypocritically declared himself the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tector
of the liberties of Greece. So said Caesar, when he blotted out
forever the splendid sun of Roman freedom. So said the Emperor Na<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />poleon,
when he wore, without a blush the diadem of the Caesars, ce<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mented
with the blood of nations, and nailed the Christian religion to
the cross of the Roman Pontiff, without remorse. And even now, at
this moment, Santa Anna declares, .that for the preservation of the
Mexican nation, and for the happiness of its citizens, he from necessity,

<pb n="782" xml:id="P0782" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/790/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="234" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

will condescend to play dictator, and save eight millions of freemen the
trouble of governing themselves. And against this principle, now pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mulgated
in the message, in its naked deformity, our brethren are in
arms; against this principle, the gallant heroes of San Antonio, fought
.and bled, and the brave and lamented Milam fell! And your army is
now concentrating on the Western frontier, to roll back the bloody tide
-of war, upon the common enemy; and can we, I would ask, silently per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mit
the lawless exercise of power at home, when we have pledged our
lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor, to repel it from abroad?</p>

<p>The power of the Executive to dissolve or adjourn the General Coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />■cil
at pleasure, without their consent, or to refuse to correspond with
them, is no where given, if it exists, it must be clearly and expresslv
defined, and not left to implication or construction. Fortunately, this
very important question, which has so direct a bearing on the very ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />istence
of the General Council, as a deliberative body, is susceptible of the
most certain and unquestionable solution. Under our system, all who
exercise power, are bound to shew, when questioned, by what authority
it is exercised. I deny the right of the Executive to question the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ceedings
of the General Council, utterly deny it, and challenge the'ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vocate
and supporter of the doctrine to exhibit his authority; to point
out the article, the section, and the clause, of the constitution of Mexico
of 1824, or, the organic law which contains it; to show in a word the
express grant of the power. None other can fulfil the requirements of
our constitution and laws.</p>

<p>I hold it an important and interesting truth, as an undeniable axiom,
and not heretofore sufficiently understood, that the Governor has no
right to exercise any implied or constructive power; he is the creature
of the constitution and the organic law, and derives all his authority
from that source; and whatever power is not expressly granted, is re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />served
to the people.</p>

<p>The assumption of power contained in the message to dissolve the
Council, without, and contrary to their express will, and questioning
their proceedings, and their motives as corrupt, together with the op<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />probious
epithets, freely applied to the members, is, in my opinion, an
outrage upon the feelings of the members, and a dangerous invasion of
the independence, the privileges, the rights and powers of the General
Council, unacknowledged by our laws, which the Executive is solemnly
sworn to obey himself, and see the same executed. The Executive, I
may add, no department, can exercise any power, without express grant
from the constitution, or by authority of law.</p>

<p>An enduring monument of praise is the proud reward to the wisdom,
that devised the plan, and no less to the patriotic statesman who carries
into succcessful execution. By it, ours is made, emphatically a consti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tutional
legal government, instead of a government moulded by the pol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />icy
or whim of those who are commissioned to enforce and execute its
powers. By it, our Government, instead of consisting of independent,
separate, conflicting and hostile departments, has all its parts and pow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ers
united harmoniously in one, without the apprehension of collision,
and without destroying the individual and independent existence of the
parts.</p>

<p>After the most mature reflection that I have been able to give the
subject, it is my settled conviction, that your honorable body ought to

<pb n="783" xml:id="P0783" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/791/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="235" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

remain in session until the meeting of the new Convention, agreeably
to the provisions of the 16th article of the organic law, which provides,
that “the Governor and Council shall continue to exist as a Provisional
Government, until the re-assembling of the Consultation, or until other
delegates are elected by the people, and another government is estab<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished.”
And it is very questionable whether the Governor has any sep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />arate
existence, independent of the existence of the General Council.—
And the present situation of our country requires that every citizen
should be at his post and perform his duty. I know you have made
many sacrifices by remaining here; but though you have done much and
performed it well, still your work is not yet finished: and the most ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />traordinary
course adopted by my predecessor, renders it necessary that
your labors should be prolonged, beyond what would have been required,
had he harmoniously continued to perform his duty as Governor. And
if your circumstances require a return to your several homes sooner
than the first day of March next; you might call the members of the
new Convention to convene on the fifteenth day of February, and the
first day of the same month or sooner, you might adjourn your body to
meet when and where the members of the next Convention meet. In
fact I would be glad to see the new Convention convene at as early a day
.as practicable. For the means of communicating the acts and proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings
of your body to the people generally, has been so limited and un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />certain,
that I have no doubt that it is the principal cause of what dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />satisfaction
that has prevailed. But I. think the policy doubtful, if not
dangerous to the public interest; upon this, as in all your former delib<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erations,
let the good of Texas be your polar star, by which you will
shape your course, and you will have the approbation of an approving
conscience, and the blessings of a free and grateful people.</p>

<p>The defenceless situation of our oppressed country calls for your
prompt attention and speedy relief. Surrounded on one side by hordes
of merciless savages, brandishing the tomahawk and scalping knife, re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cently
red with human gore; and on the other, the less merciful glitter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
spear and ruthless sword of the descendents of Cortes, and his mod<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ern
Goths and Vandals, make it in my opinion your paramount duty as a
Council, to remain permanently in session until the Convention meets,
as there is no other authority to provide for the speedy organization
of the ranging corps, and particularly for the security and protection
of the inhabitants of the frontier of Red River, where no force is yet
-.stationed or raised. And I would respectfully recommend to your con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sideration
the propriety of raising and officering the detachments of
rangers from the inhabitants of the frontier where they are designed
to range; that it would operate to increase the activity and vigilance of
the corps and promote their harmony, I entertain little doubt.</p>

<p>The regular army is not yet recruited and filled up, and the enemy is
preparing a large force to demonstrate upon us early in the spring; and
should another attempt be made to invade Texas which we may have
every reason to believe, will be done, we may expect a much more form<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />idable
enemy in point of numbers at least, than we have yet had to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tend
against. The organization of an efficient army in the field, and the
means necessary for their support and comfort will, I am persuaded, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinue
to occupy your time until so desirable an object is fully accom<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />plished.
I recommend to your consideration the propriety of reducing

<pb n="784" xml:id="P0784" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/792/" />
<pb ed="unknown" n="236" />
<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

the number of field and company officers in the regiment of artillery; the
excess of officers in their corps, over the usual number, is a ground of
complaint, and the objection, as far as my knowledge extends, is well
founded. In the present embarrassed state of the treasury, rigid econ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />omy,
and strict accountability is absolutely necessary, to secure a govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
for the people unfettered by an overwhelming national debt. I
would call your attention to the situation of the public lands, and the
embarrassments to the bona fide settler consequent upon the closing
of the land officers by the General Convention. It is believed, that the
reason which induced that honorable body to close them by the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visions
of the fourteenth article of the organic law, no longer exists and
that the re-opening of the same would be of great public utility. I would
therefore suggest the expediency of providing by law for the disposition
of public lands, to actual settlers now in Texas, or who may emigrate
here and settle on their locations in accordance with the provisions of
the organic law, and laws of colonization. And those citizens whose
titles are not fully forfeited, should be authorized to receive them under
such rules and regulations, as you in your wisdom may think proper.
But at the same time, I would doubt the expediency of permitting any
locations of large claims to, or grants of the public domain, until the
meeting of the convention, when the members will come clothed with
plenary powers from the sovereign people. And until the land offices
can be thoroughly systematized by the competent authority hereafter to
be appointed; when the policy that is to govern the country in the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />position
of the public lands, can be adopted by that honorable body.</p>

<p>I would recommend to your attention, the propriety of opening and
organizing the courts of justice, on the basis of the comman law of
England, as being not only the best system of jurisprudence extant, but
as being more extensively known, and better adapted to the wants and
customs of the citizens; and as a system, it has withstood the attack of
tyranny in Europe and America, and finally triumphed. The citizens
of Texas are a constitutional and law-abiding people, they look there
for safety and protection in the last resort, as regards questions among
themselves; and next to doing justice, in importance, is, that it should
be speedily administered; for it is an important fact that a delay of jus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tice,
in many cases, is tantamount to a denial of justice; and the organi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zation
of the judiciary is a measure necessary to secure peace and good
order in society, and to protect and secure the property and persons of
our fellow citizens generally.</p>

<p>I would ask your attention to the propriety and necessity of passing
an ordinance and decree, regulating marriages, divorces, and alimony.
And also one in relation to ferries and bridges, on military and post
roads, so as to insure the regular transportation of the mail, and facili<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tate
the movements of the troops in time of war, as well as ammunition
and supplies for the army.</p>

<p>The defence and protection of the seaboard from the attacks of the ene<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />my’s
armed vessels, will I am persuaded' receive your earliest and most de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />liberate
attention; the flourishing towns upon the coast of the Gulf of
Mexico are greatly exposed to the enemy, and as a temporary protec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
until an effectual safeguard can be provided for their security, I
would invite your attention to the propriety of erecting one or more
batteries at each port and town, upon the sea coast, and I would also

<fw type="header" place="top">Proceedings of the General Council.</fw>

advise the survey of the several ports of Texas, with a view to make the
intercourse with our country more secure, and it is confidently believed
that the rate of insurance would be thereby greatly diminished.</p>

<p>A measure intimately connected with the commerce and prosperity
of the country, is the duty on imposts and tonnage. The rate of duty
as now established by law, is, in my opinion too high, in the present situ<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ation
of the country. I would therefore very respectfully recommend, in
lieu of fifteen and twenty-five per cent, ad valorem duty, that ten and
twenty per cent be levied and collected under the rules and regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
as now prescribed by law. It is the interest of our country, to
invite capital and emigrants, by affording every facility in our power
consistent with the other important interests of our country.</p>

<p>As a necessary and important measure that stands intimately connected
with the defence of the country, and one to which I invite your attention,
is the creation and due organization of a corps of marines, and as you
have purchased two vessels for the public service, and shortly expect two<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />more,
to be purchased by your agents abroad, it would be very desirable
to have that corps organized, and ready for service' with as little delay as.
possible. I herewith transmit to your honorable body sundry letters rec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ommendatory
of lieutenant Francis Nevill, late of the United States ma<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rines,
and from my knowledge of the gentleman recommending lieutenant.
Nevill, I would respectfully recommend him for a captain in said corps.</p>

<p>Permit me to invite your kind attention to the organization of that
part of Texas laying on or near Bed River, into one or more municipality
or municipalities, and provide suitable municipal officers, for the due ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ministration
of justice, and that they be allowed their due representation,
in proportion to the number of inhabitants, in your Council, and in the
next convention, and that you invite the freemen of Red River to join
you in putting down military rule in our country. And the speedy es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablishment
of a mail route from the town of "Nacogdoches to Pecan
point, Jonesborough, and such other places, near Red River, as you may
deem necessary, is respectfully recommended, as the only sure and speedy
means of communicating with that interesting part of the country, and
I would ask your instructions and directions to the post-master general
on this subject. As connected with the interests of the people of Red
River, a letter from the-Hon. John Forbes, is herewith communicated^
and the sentiments therein contained, respectfully recommended to your
consideration.</p>

<p>I herewith transmit a letter of recommendation from Major Arthur
Henrie in favor of lieutenant Henry Teal and Jacob Snively, and giving
notice of the non-acceptance of Mr. James Carter of his appointment of
captain in the regular army, all of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>The condition of our fellow-citizens at San Antonio who were wounded
at the storming of that fortress, and that of the garrison and town at that
place, will claim your earliest attention. I am informed that many of the
brave men at that post, are without the necessary means to promote their
recovery from wounds received in your defence, and the troops stationed
there are represented to be in want of the necessary supplies, and many
of the unfortunate inhabitants reduced, by the war, from opulence and
case, to penury and want; humanity and sound policy alike dictate the
adoption of such measures, as their misfortunes and sufferings require,
and your philanthropy will generously extend, and the only relief I ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prehend

necessary, will be a fair and equitable remuneration for losses
sustained by the campaign against San Antonio.</p>

<p>The widows and orphans of the heroic men who have fallen in battle
in the defence of the rights and liberties of the people of Texas, or died
in the service, expect you to extend a kind and parental hand for their
relief.</p>

<p>To generously reward those who nobly fall, fighting for constitutional
liberty, by wiping the tear of sorrow from the cheek of the bereaved
widow and the unprotected orphan, made so in our defence, is among
your imperative duties, and will receive, I am persuaded, your willing<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />care
and prompt attention.</p>

who are settled, or who. have claims to lands within, or near
the settlement of the Cherokee and other tribes of Indians. And I would
also recommend the immediate appointment of a commissioner to treat
with the said Indians, to act in the place of General Sam Houston, who
is on the march of the western frontier, and cannot now meet and co<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />operate
with the other commissioners already appointed. I deem this an
important and necessary measure, tending to the protection and security
of the frontier settlements, by securing the friendship of the Indians, and
at the same time doing justice to our own citizens, whose rights ought to
be preserved inviolate.</p>

<p>On the rigorous prosecution of the war against the Centralists of Mex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ico,
with General Santa Anna for their leader, depends the safety and
happiness, the liberty, nay, the very existence of the Anglo-American
population in Texas; and their friends who have, and are co-operating
with them. Allow me to urge the immediate reduction of the town of
Matamoras, and its dependencies, together with all places on or near Rio
Grande, that would give the country immediate facilities, that will great<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ly
accelerate our future operations, and put it in our power, either to
carry the horrors of war into the enemy’s country, or conclude a peace
both honorable and advantageous to ourselves; for be assured the terms
must be dictated to the enemy by the triumph of our arms. And I in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dulge
the hope that every measure calculated to promote so desirable an
object will meet with your prompt and cordial attention.</p>

<p>Permit me to congratulate you and the country on the union and har<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mony
of your councils, that have so happily prevailed throughout your
deliberations; and it is confidently hoped that the same devotion to the
best interests of the country may continue to animate and guide you to
the termination of your arduous labors, union of councils, and a vigorous
co-operation of all parts of the country, with the able and timely aid from
our friends in the United States, have already driven the proud and vain<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />glorious
oppressor beyond our border, and given an earnest of what may
be expected if he has the temerity, to profane, with his unhallowed foot<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />steps,
the soil of freemen, the pathway that he shall be compelled to take
in his flight, will be crimsoned by the best blood of his nation, and his
funeral pile will serve as a beacon light, for future generations, to be-,
ware, how they invade the rights and privileges of the countrymen of
Washington, who like the strong man armed, they will lay hold of the

as reasons satisfactory to the General Council, have induced them
to suspend the functions of the late Governor Smith, any refusal on the
part of any officer of the Government to recognize their acts, or to obey
its legal orders, consequent upon the measures adopted, must be regarded
as contumelious and in contempt of the representatives of the sovereign
people, in general council assembled, and the usual course pursued,, as
regards such persons, as the. precedents of other governments, framed
upon republican principles, will point out and justify.</p>

<p>The journal of yesterday’s proceedings being read,</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett, chairman of the committee on state and judiciary, to

which was read and adopted:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable the General Council of the Provisional Govern<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your committee on state and judiciary, to whom was referred the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />port
of the auditor, with certain accounts, report,</p>

<p>That the course adopted by the auditor, for drawing upon the Treas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />urer
in favor of assignees, or those having the equitable interest in claims
upon the Government, by legal transfer of the original owner, made in
writing is correct, provided, his entry on the book of records be so kept
as to show the name of the original claimant, and the use expressed, to<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gether
with the name of the assignee or person to whom claims are so
transferred, in such manner as to guard against frauds.—The evidence
required by law for proving such claims, should be as in other cases.</p>

<p>The account of H. H. Cone and L. H. Mabbitt appear upon the face to
be correct, but your committee are not in possession of any facts which
otherwise call for the equitable interposition of the powers of this House;
which your committee advise should never be extended, except in cases
when manifest injury will arise to persons having strong equitable cir<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cumstances
in their favor, and can clearly show, that the legal proof for
establishing their rights, is not within their control.</p>

<p>Your committee therefore return the two accounts to this Council, and
ask to be discharged from the further consideration thereof.</p>

of John J. Linn, report,</p>

<p>That upon considering the request of the petitioner, they are of opinion
that the practice of granting the right of reprisals upon land, in favor of
citizens against the enemy, is dangerous, and might lead to acts of great
injustice and oppression, especially in case of civil war; and however in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />clined

to extend all proper aid to the petitioner for the protection of his
property, in the enemy’s country. Your committee cannot advise this
Council to place the administration of justice into the hands of an indi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vidual
in his own case.—Should it hereafter appear, that Mr. Linn, or
any other person, has suffered loss by the enemy, under such circum<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />stances
as justice would require the community to sustain, by making
amends, your committee are of opinion, that it should be done directly
from the public Treasury, rather than by the plan proposed by the peti<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tioner,
in the present application.</p>

<p>January 16 th, 1836.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, from a select committee, to-whom was referred a petition
for certain papers in the Land Office, made the following report; which
was read and laid on the table:</p>

<p>Your committee, who was appointed to inquire into'the propriety of
opening the land offices, so far as to give to the actual settlers, the citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens
and those who emigrated to Texas, under the colonization laws, and
whe have never received the land to which they were entitled as emi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />grants,
settlers or citizens, report as follows:</p>

<p>Whereas, many of our fellow-citizens having been compelled to leave
their home and their business, for the purpose of defending their rights,
and protecting the country against an invading foe, and believing if all
important, (as it really was,) to direct the public attention, and to con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />centrate
all the strength of the country to that single point, to wit,
Bexar, for the purpose of dividing from Texas her most deadly enemies,
those who were determined to oppress and destroy us, and (to use their
own language,) to make Texas a howling wilderness, and believing, that,
by stopping all land operations, for the present, would conduce in a great
degree to bring about an object so desirable, I advocated and supported
every measure and act of the House, which had for its object, the closing
of the Land Offices. Believing, too, that those in the service of their
country, should have at least as good an opportunity of improving their
fortune, and bettering their condition in life, as those remaining at home,
I thought it nothing but justice, on all sides, to close for a time, all busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness
connected with the Land Offices. Besides, I was induced to believe
from communications which I received, that fraud would be practised and
injustice done, by surveying and granting titles to locations of land, to
which those absent were entitled.</p>

<p>But the cause and reason why I was desirous of stopping all landed
operations) having ceased, to as great an extent, as can be expected dur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
the unsettled state of our affairs and condition, which may continue
for years. And believing it to be essential to the great and permanent
interests of Texas, to re-open and renew the Land Offices, and landed
operations throughout the country.</p>

<p>I therefore earnestly recommend to the General Council of the Pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visional
Government of Texas, the adoption of such measures as will tend
to that end as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>My reasons are these,-—</p>

<p>First.-The citizens who were at Bexar, have generally returned home.</p>

<p>Second.—It will harmonize the feelings and unite the people of the
country.</p>

<p>Third.-It will increase our population.</p>

<p>Fourth.—It will increase our wealth.</p>

<p>Fifth.-By permitting the emigrants who come into Texas, to receive
their lands as prescribed by the colonization laws, under the constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of 1824, will prove to the world that we are not endeavoring to rob
Mexico of her lands, as has been represented to be our object.</p>

<p>Sixth.—We have declared in favor of the constitution of 1824, and
the colonization law, under that constitution, guarantees and secures
to every emigrant his head right to land as there set forth. These rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sons
are sufficient to convince, I trust, every impartial and unprejudiced
person of the propriety and necessity of opening the Land Offices.</p>

<p>If we wish to get men to assist in protecting Texas, we should give
them such interest in the country, as to induce them to become citizens,
and they will be ready and willing, at any and all times, to defend and
protect their property, their homes and their fire sides. It is also of
the utmost importance to throw open every door and avenue, by which
capital and property of' every description will flow into the country.</p>

<p>We should spare no pains to increase the population and wealth of our
country, in order that the burthen and expenses of the war may be
divided and made lighter, and render those in the country who have
generously contributed their aid, more able to bear it.</p>

<p>Many other reasons might be offered equally as good in support of the
measure recommended in this report. Every individual must see and
feel the necessity of strengthening ourselves in every respect, and way,
and that as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>Mr. Royall presented the following resolution; which was read and
laid on the table:</p>

<p>Be it further resolved that Austin Brian call upon Doctor Peebles,
commissioner appointed by the 'Convention to take possession of the
land papers, and that the said commissioner be required to furnish him
such copies of papers as his petition contemplated.</p>

<p>The President submitted the following communication from C. B.
Stewart, Executive Secretary, in reply to the charge of contempt, and
tendering his resignation; which was read, viz:</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the President and members of the Legislative Council of Texas:</hl></p>

<p>Your commands requiring me to answer to the charges of contumely
and contempt for your honorable body.in non-obedience of certain reso<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lutions,
I will endeavor to comply with.</p>

<p>The construction which I have and am compelled to place upon the

existence of any other Provisional Government, than that created by the
superior power of the Convention; which consisting of a Governor and

<p>Your honorable body, and his Excellency, Henry Smith, thus created,

as the only Executive power. In my own capacity, created by the Gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
Council, claimed by the Executive, and executing the duties of an
officer of the General Council, it would be difficult to determine by
whom I should be controlled, did not the nomination and appointment
as Secretary to the Executive Department, and the duties defined in
the law creating a Treasurer, Secretary; &amp;c., defining their duties, clearly
place me subject to the Executive Head, its immediate control. In rea<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />son
and truth, I have not much to allege to absolve myself of the charges
above referred to of’contempt of the “Representatives in Council of the
sovereign people;” and if possible to prevent the recurrence of them by
such course as your honorable body may think best; and by granting me
permission to tender my resignation.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,</p>

<p>With all respect, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>C. B. STEWART.</p>

<p>January 15th, 1836.</p>

<p>The Council having deliberated upon the above communication, the
question was put by the President, “has the aforesaid Charles B. Stewart,
Esq., as Secretary to the Executive, cleared and purged himself of the
said contempt of this House, wherewith he stands charged;” when the
House unanimously responded in the negative.</p>

<p>On motion, the following question was then put:</p>

<p>“Is the aforesaid Charles B. Stewart, guilty of contempt and con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tumely
of the Representatives of the people of Texas, in General Council
assembled?”</p>

<p>Whereupon the ayes and nays were called, and there were in the
affirmative, Messrs. Burnham, Jones, Clements, Hanks, Barrett, Royall,
Malone, McMullen, Tucker, Thompson, Collard and Patllo.</p>

<p>So the question was canned in the affirmative by unanimous vote.</p>

<p>The question was then put by the President of the Council.</p>

<p>“What shall be the penalty affixed and adjudged upon the said Charles
B. Stewart, for his aforesaid contempt?”</p>

<p>When, on motion, the sum of two thousand five hundred dollars fine,
was submitted to the consideration of the Council; which, after some
discussion, the ayes and nays being called for, stood as follows:</p>

<p>AYES.—Messrs. Burnham, Jones, Clements, Hanks, Barrett, Royall,
Malone, Thompson.—8.</p>

<p>NAYS.—Messrs. Collard, Tucker, McMullen, Patillo.—4.</p>

<p>So the question was decided in the affirmative, and the fine of two
thousand five hundred dollars agreed to.</p>

<p>Whereupon the following judgment of the Council, on motion of Mr.
Barrett, was unanimously adopted and entered, and a copy thereof di<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rected
to be made out and served upon the said Charles B. Stewart.</p>

<p>“Ordered by the General Council that C. B. Stewart, Secretary to the

in not obeying its order, requiring him to communicate officially with
James W. Robinson, acting Governor of Texas, and to hold all official
documents, records and correspondence, subject to the order of this
House, to be remitted, however, if the said C. B. Stewart, Secretary as
aforesaid, shall at or before nine o’clock on Monday next, comply with
the orders he has heretofore received from this Council, in regard to
his said office, and his official communications.”</p>

<p>A copy of the foregoing was served upon Mr. Stewart the same day.</p>

<p>Certain1 letters and charges were presented against Judge Mason of
Brazoria; which were read and referred to the committee on state and
judiciary.</p>

<p>The President submitted a communication from A. Briscoe; which
was read and-referred to the committee of finance.</p>

<p>The President also submitted a letter from T. J. Rusk; which was read
and referred to the committee on military affairs.</p>

<p>The following message was received from the acting Governor, which
was read and referred to the committee on the state and judiciary.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable the President and Members of the General Council:</hl></p>

<p>GENTLEMEN—</p>

<p>I beg leave respectfully to ask your attention to the importance and
necessity of having a Secretary to the Executive, as it is difficult, if not
impossible, to discharge the functions of that important department,
without an efficient person to fill the situation, and allow me to ask, as
a particular favor, the appointment of E. M. Pease Esq., as eminently
qualified to perform the duties of the office. But this, as all other ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pointments,
being exclusively within your province to make, I will cheer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
acquiesce in any selection you, in your better judgment, may deem
best calculated to promote the public welfare.</p>

<p>Letters and communications daily arrive in this place, through the
post office, by express and by private conveyance, directed to “Henry
Smith, Governor of Texas.”</p>

<p>I would ask your honorable body to direct me, as my legal advisers,
whether being so officially directed, I ought to open them as the only
legal Executive. I am without the means of knowing what instructions
have been given to our foreign agents or Indian commissioners, or orders
to the commanding General, or any officer either civil or military, nei<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ther
do I know what laws are and what are not published, and as the
order of your .honorable body makes it my imperative duty to cause them
to be published in the Telegraph and Register of San Felipe de Austin,
and in the Texian and Emigrant’s Guide in Nacogdoches, it will be
difficult for me to perform my duty in relation thereto, unless I am put
in possession of the public archives, now in the possession of my pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />decessor,
and by him pertinaciously withheld through the instrumen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tality
of his late Secretary.</p>

<p>With sentiments, &amp;c.,</p>

<p>JAMES W. ROBINSON.</p>

<p>On motion, the Council adjourned to three o’clock, p. m.</p>

which he represents was in town, and asked leave of absence
for himself; which was granted on condition that he should bring in

<p>On motion of Mr. Barrett, the House took up the ordinance and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cree

required to repair immediately to the city of Bexar, for the purpose of

the same into effect; and that John W. Smith or the collector of public

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable the President and, Members of the Convention:</hl></p>

<p>The undersigned, members of the General Council of the Provisional
Government, have understood from some sources, that the verbal notice<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />given
us a few clays since, by a committee of your honorable body, that
the convention was organized, was deemed a sufficient announcement
that the powers of the Provisional Government had ceased. This, from
our understanding of the organic law, we did not think to be the case,
nor that we could be relieved, without some'declaration on the part of
the Convention. Accordingly we replied verbally to your committee,
that we were ready to surrender the archives of the Council, into the
hands of a committee, or any authority acting as a government, pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visionally
or otherwise. The unfortunate difficulties that arose between
the different branches of the Provisional Government, of which it is
unnecessary to speak at this time, in some measure crippled its operations
and prevented it from acting with that energy so necessary in a crisis
like the present. This state of things we expected, would induce the
Convention to organize immediately some temporary authority to meet
the present exigencies of the country. We could not suppose that the
Convention superseded the Provisional Government, without some dec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />laration
on their part of such fact. If it is so deemed by your honorable
body or if any authority is designated to receive the archives, we shall be
ready to deliver them, and return them, and return with pleasure to our
homes and the field.</p>

Robinson and the late Council, the late Treasurer, the late Audit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />or
and Comptroller of public accounts, be requested to deliver to this
House, all the books, papers, journals, correspondence, contracts, orders,
laws and all other papers connected with or relating to their several
offices.</p>

<p>Resolved, that the Secretary of this House make out, and hand forth<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />with
to each of the aforementioned individuals a copy of this resolution,
and request of them the books and papers referred to.</p>

<p>(A copy.)</p>

<p>Attest,</p>

<p>H. S. KEMBLE, Sec’ry.</p>

<p>The foregoing having been read,</p>

<p>The following reply was submitted and approved, and directed to be
signed by the members present.</p>

<p><hl rend="italics">To the Honorable, the President, and members of the Convention:</hl></p>

<p>The undersigned, members of the General Council, present acknowl<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />edge
the receipt, by the hand of your secretary, of a resolution of your
honorable body, requesting the archives of the General Council. In
reply we have to say that they are at your disposal. From an examina<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of them it will be seen, that the necessary laws have been passed to
prepare the country for a vigorous defence against her enemies, and for
the regulation of our civil affairs, which if properly executed will be suf<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ficient
to meet the wants of the country, until a new organization takes
place under the constitution, to be framed by your body. Since the eigh<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />teenth
day of January last, there has not been a quorum of the Council
present; previous to that date, however, (foreseeing that such’ an event
might happen,) resolutions by the Council were passed, dividing the
members that might remain into committees, for the purpose of advising
the Executive, as required by the organic law, and transacting such busi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ness
as might be of pressing importance: such as filling vacancies in
offices, providing expresses, advising instructions to agents and to mili<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tary
officers, &amp;c., copies of all which will be found in the executive office.</p>

<p>The secretary of the Council has directions to deliver the archives, at
any time when called; he has been for some time past engaged in tran<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribing
the journals into a book for more convenient reference and their

safe preservation, a matter that has been delayed for want of stationery.
He will, if permitted to have access to them for a few days, complete
the work without any charge to the government.</p>

<p>With sentiments of high</p>

<p>consideration and respect.</p>

<p>The following resolution was ordered to be entered:</p>

<p>Resolved, that inasmuch as the Convention has assumed to itself the
powers of a government, and made a demand for the archives of this
body, we deem it a duty to yield to that call, and surrender our trust
into their hands, although not in accordance with the provisions of the
organic law, yet we are confident that an apology for this course will be
found in the present distracted state of public affairs, and a wish on our
part to do all in our power, to promote union and concert of action in
the defence of our beloved country against her merciless invaders.</p>
