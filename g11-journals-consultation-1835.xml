On motion of Mr. S. Houston, the house proceeded to an election of
president and other officers.
Whereupon, B. T. Archer was elected president, and P. B. Dexter,
secretary.
Mr. Archer, on taking the chair, delivered the following address:
Gentlemen—I return you my thanks for the honor you have conferred
on me. The duties which devolve on the members of this body are ardu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ous
and highly important; in fact, the destinies of Texas are placed in
your hands; and I hope that you are now assembled, in every way pre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pared
to discharge those duties in a manner creditable to yourselves and
beneficial to your country. I call upon each and all of you to divest your<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />selves
of all party feelings, to discard every selfish motive, and look alone
to the true interest of your country. In the words of the Hebrew pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />phet,
I would say, “Put off your shoes, for the ground upon which you
stand is holy.” The rights and .liberties of thousands of freemen are in
your hands, and millions yet unborn may be affected by your decisions.
The first measure that will be brought before the house, will be a de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />claration
in which we will set forth to the world the causes which have
impelled us to take up arms, and the objects for which we fight.
Secondly. I will suggest for your consideration the propriety of es<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tablishing
a provisional government, the election of a governor, lieuten<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ant
governor and council; and I would recommend that these officers
be clothed with both legislative and executive powers. This measure I
conceive absolutely necessary to prevent Texas from falling into the
labyrinth of anarchy.
Thirdly. The organization of the military requires your immediate
attention. You have an army in the field whose achievements have al<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ready
shed lustre upon our arms, they have not the provisions and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forts
necessary to continue their services in the field; give them char<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />acter
or their victories, though they are achieved not without danger and
glory, will, nevertheless, be unproductive of good; sustain and support
them and they will do honor to you, and render incalculable services to
their country; but neglect them, Texas is lost. The adoption of a code
of military laws is indispensable; without discipline and order in the
ranks, your armies will be mobs, more dangerous to themselves than to
their adversaries, and liable at all times to be routed and cut to pieces
by a handful of regulars. I know the men that are now in the field; there
(510)</p><pb n="511" xml:id="P0511" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/519/" /><p>Journals of the Consultation.

never were better materials for soldiers; but without discipline they can
achieve nothing. Establish military laws, and like the dragon’s teeth
sown by Cadmus, they will produce armed men. It will be necessary
to procure funds in order to establish the contemplated government, and
to.carry on the war in which we are now engaged; it will, therefore, be our
duty to elect agents to procure those funds. I have too high an opinion
of the plain practical sense of the members of this body, to think for a
moment, that they will elect any but some of our most influential citizens
to this important post. Without funds, however heroically your armies
may fight, however wisely your councils may legislate, they will erect
but a baseless fabric that will fall of its own weight.
There are several warlike and powerful tribes of Indians, that claim
certain portions of our lands. Locations have been made within the
limits they claim, which has created great dissatisfaction amongst them;
some of the chiefs of those tribes are expected here in a few days; and I
deem it expedient to make some equitable arrangement of the matter
that will prove satisfactory to them.
Permit me to call your attention to another subject. Some of our
brethren of the United States of the north, hearing of our difficulties,
have generously come to our aid, many more ere long will be with us;
services such as they will render, should never be forgotten. It will be
proper for this convention to secure to them the rights and privileges of
citizens, to secure to them their land “in head rights,” and place them
on the same footing with those of our citizens who have not yet obtained
from government their lands; and in all other respects to place them
on an equal footing with our most favored citizens. Again, the path
to promotion must be open, they must know that deeds of chivalry and
heroism will meet their rewards, and that you will throw no obstruction
in their pathway to fame.
Some fraudulent sales or grants of land, by the late government of
Coahuila and Texas, will require your attention. The establishment of
mails, and an express department, is deemed necessary to promote the
interest of the country; besides other minor matters that have escaped
my observation in this cursory review.
Finally, Gentlemen and friends, let me call your attention from these
details to the high position which you now occupy; let me remind
you that the eyes of the world are upon you; that battling as we are
against the despotism of a military chieftain, all true republicans, all
friends to the liberties of man, are anxious spectators of the conflict, or
deeply interested in the cause. Let us give evidence that we are the
true descendants of that band of heroes, who sustained an eight years’
war against tyranny and oppression and gave liberty to a new world.
Let our achievements be such that our mother country, when she reads
the bright page that records them, shall proudly and joyfully exclaim,
these are my sons! their heroic deeds mark them as such.
Again, gentlemen, let me admonish you that “the ground on which
you stand is holy,’’that your decisions will affect the rights and liberties
■of thousands of freemen, and destinies of millions yet unborn, and per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />haps
the cause of liberty itself. I do not view the cause in which we
are engaged, as that of freemen fighting alone against military despotism;
I do not view it as Texas battling alone for her rights and her liberties;
I view it in a more nobler, more exalted light, I view it as the great

work of laying the corner stone of liberty in the great Mexican
republic.
On motion, Mr. Pettus was appointed sergeant-at-arms of the con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention,
with the privilege (in the event of his having more important
duties to perform,) of appointing a deputy.
The following resolution, offered by Mr. S. Houston, was unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, The general Convention of all Texas, assembled, have learned,
with great pleasure, that a detachment of the army of the people, under
the command of Col. James Bowie and Capt. J. W. Fannin, on the
morning of the th of October, encountered a detachment of the army
of General Cos, consisting of about four hundred men, cavalry and in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fantry,
while their force only consisted of ninety-two, rank ond file, near
the mission of Conception, and obtained a complete victory over them.
While the loss of the Anglo-Americans was one man dangerously wound<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed;
and the loss of the enemy, sixteen found dead on the field of battle,
with the supposed loss of sixteen more borne off. Therefore,
Resolved, That the thanks of the convention be rendered to Gen. Aus<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tin,
Col. James Bowie and Capt. J. W. Fannin, with the troops engaged
in the action, as a tribute due to their heroism, gallantry and valor, in the
defence of the rights of Texas and constitutional liberty.
Mr. E. Hall, agent of a committee in New-Orleans, presented certain
documents, which were read, and on motion of Mr. Wharton, ordered
that they be laid on the table.
On motion of Mr. Robinson, a committee of five was appointed to take
into consideration the communications from the New-Orleans commit<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tee;
and Messrs. J. A. Wharton, S. Houston, Robinson, Royal and D.
Parker were appointed on that committee, with instructions to report
thereon.
Mr. Royal asked and obtained leave to read a report from the general
council, containing an exhibit of the proceedings of that body.
San Felipe de Austin, Nov. 1st, 1835.
To the honorable Consultation of the chosen delegates of all Texas, in
general convention assembled—
The general council begs leave to report, that now on the organiza<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of your honorable body the duties of the council terminate, and it
is with much satisfaction that we surrender into your hands the records
of our proceedings. In the discharge of its duties, it became necessary
for the council to take the responsibility of acts of magnitude, if in
doing so we have transcended the authority that was intended to be dele<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gated
to us, we hope that the liberality of your assembly will attribute
it to motives of rendering important, if not indispensable, aid to the cause
in which Texas is engaged.
As the most trivial acts of the council are on record, and too numerous
to be couched in this report, it will present to your consideration at the
moment, the most important acts, and those incurring the greatest re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sponsibility,
that you may improve or reform as your wisdom may ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prove.

On the fourteenth of October, Mr. Sims Hall was commissioned as con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tractor

are on the way, or repairing to headquarters; and as connected with this
subject, we will also inform you that supplies of sugar, coffee, bacon,
blankets, shoes, tent clothes, &amp;c., have been forwarded from Columbia,
Brazoria and Matagorda. But as winter is approaching, high water and
bad roads may be expected, we, therefore, recommend that a. large quan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tity
be forwarded to head quarters or some convenient point.
We have reasons to believe that one eighteen pounder, and a twelve
pounder of artillery are on the way, with a fair proportion of powder
and ball.
We have authorised the raising of twenty-five volunteer rangers, to
range between Colorado and Brazos, on the frontier settlements; twenty<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />five
between Brazos and Trinity rivers, and thirty-five east of the Trinity
river; promising each volunteer one dollar and twenty-five cents per day.
The council has made provisions for the collection of the public dues;
on file marked G. This it will be necessary to take up and revise.
The council has ordered to be carried into effect, by subscription under
certain regulations, a mail route from San Felipe de Austin to Canton<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
Jessup, in the United States, to head quarters of the army or to
Bexar and to Velasco. This subject should, at a suitable time, be taken
up, and branch routes be ordered. These resolutions are on file marked
H; and to carry the project into effect, the council appointed John Rice
Jones, post master general.
On the twenty-sixth of October the council drafted an address to the
people of the United States of the north, which was forwarded to the
editors at Natchitoches for publication, and will be found on file mark<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ed
M.
On the twenty-seventh the council passed a resolution, requiring the
suspension of the proceedings of the various land offices, for reasons
therein stated, which will be found on file marked N, copies of which,
have been ordered to be served on all the land commissioners.
We authorised a contract for a loan of one hundred thousand dollars
of the citizens of New Orleans, and appointed T. F. McKinney an agent
to repair to New Orleans, and to carry it into effect, under instructions
on file marked 0.
On the thirty-first, the council received a number of letters from
Thomas F. McKinney, and other gentlemen of the lower country, urging
the necessity of the council granting letters to certain persons therein
named, to cruise for Mexican armed vessels; which was granted and com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />missions
issued, and a copy on file marked P, and accompanied with in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />structions
marked G.
Our finances arising from the receipts of dues for lands, as will
appear on file in Mr. Gail Borden’s report, marked F, which were in his
hands, is fifty-eight dollars and thirty cents; this money has been ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hausted,
and an advance by the president of the council of thirty-six dol<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lars.
There were also several hundred dollars in the hands of Mr. Money,
the alcalde of the Municipality of Austin; upon this money several ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vances
have been made by Mr. Cochran, and probably will nearly cover
the amount of the money in the alcalde’s hands; as such, you may consider
that at this moment, the council is out of funds.
Two Mexican officers, prisoners of war, are now on parole of honor,
having the privilege of the town of San Felipe; it will be necessary that

the president or some appointed authority of your body have observation
over them, as may be usual or necessary.
As some days may pass by before the consultation organize, a proper
authority to receive and despatch expresses, the council is of opinion
should be attended to, and the council is of opinion that you should
appoint a committee for that purpose.

liberties, which were threatened by the encroachments of military despots,,
and in defence of the republican principles of the federal constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of Mexico, of eighteen and twenty-four.
3d. That Texas is no longer morally or civilly bound by the compact
of union; yet, stimulated by the generosity and sympathy common to a
free people, they offer their support and assistance to such of the mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bers
of the Mexican confederacy as will take up arms against military des<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />potism.

3d. That they do not acknowledge that the present authorities of the
nominal Mexican republic have the right to govern within the limits of
Texas.
4th. That they will not cease to carry on war against the said authori<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ties
whilst their troops are within the limits of Texas.
5th. That they hold it to be their right during the disorganization of
the federal system, and the reign of despotism, to withdraw from the
union, to establish an independent government, or to adopt such meas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ures
as they may deem best calculated to protect their rights and lib<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erties,

debts contracted by her agents.

TO REPORT:
That the communications from the committee of New Orleans, of
which Wm. Christy and James Ramage, Esqrs., were the acting members,
contain information of the most important and flattering nature. The
committee informs us that one company of fifty men, well armed and pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vided,
will leave there on the 21st ultimo, to go via Natchitoches—an<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />other,
numbering sixty-five, would accompany Mr. Hall; “and a vessel
well furnished and manned, by about one hundred and fifty efficient emi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />grants,
would sail about the 27th ultimo for Tampico, under the com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mand
of Gen. Mexia.” The committee, in conclusion, say to us, “with
such acquisitions to your present force and resources,we trust that matters
will be brought to a speedy and glorious termination. God be with you.”
Mr. Hall in his statement to this committee says, “that the amount sub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scribed
by the citizens of New Orleans, previous to his leaving, was about
seven thousand dollars—three thousand five hundred of which was ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pended
by him in arming and equipping, &amp;c., one hundred men, and fur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />nishing
provisions, saddles, bridles, &amp;c. to sixty-five of that number, called
the Volunteer Grays, who accompanied him to Brazoria, and immediately
repaired to Goliad. The fifty men sent to Nacogdoches were furnished
with arms and equipments, only trusting to the inhabitants of the coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />try
through which they may pass, for further necessary supplies; “and
that seventy-eight barrels of navy bread, two barrels of beans and two
barrels of pork, for the use of the army, to be forwarded as the conven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion

Brazoria. He further states that, that “the committee at New Orleans
were daily receiving subscriptions, which are probably augmented to ten

ammunition, &amp;c. &amp;c. There are also volunteer companies being formed
for the service of this country, and are only waiting for communications
from your convention to tender their immediate services.

Orleans have so generously extended their munificent hand, in timely aid
of their brethren in Texas, who are now battling under the walls of San
Antonio for constitutional liberty and the rights of man, as did their
forefathers of the north on Bunker’s Hill and on Charlestown plains, and
as your own brave citizens did against a mercenary soldiery, who fought
for “booty and beauty.”
This consultation of the chosen delegates of all Texas in general con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />vention
assembled, deeply impressed with a sense of gratitude for the
succor that has been sent, and for the sympathy that has been manifested
for our citizens who are threatened by the military despot of Mexico,
that unless they yield unconditional submission they shall feel the iron
rod of unrelenting oppression, tender their most grateful acknowledge<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments
to the citizens of your city for their kindness and fraternal feel<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
and interposition, and we trust that no act of ours will ever cause a
blush of shame upon their cheek at the remembrance of the early support.
they gave the cause of free institutions in Texas.
Any who embark in our cause, in the army or navy, shall be liberally
rewarded in land and money, and in the blessings of a grateful and re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />deemed
people. We would solicit a continuance of your kind offices, until
we are delivered from the unhallowed grasp of our oppressors, and put in
undisputable possession of our inalienable rights. And we would respect<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fully
suggest, that in sending us any supplies of men, money or muni<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
of war, that you direct them not to land west of the bay of Mata<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gorda,
and perhaps the mouth of the Brazos river would be the most ad<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visable
point to land whatever support our friends may send, to enable us
to defend the rights guaranteed by the constitution of 1824.
The address of the president' of the convention, on taking the chair,
which is herewith transmitted, will give you and through you, the citi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />zens

Journals of the Consultation.
San Felipe de Austin, Nov. 13th, 1835. )
Eight o’clock, a. M. 5
The house met pursuant to adjournment, the journals of the proceed<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ings
of yesterday were read.
Mr. Barrett, from the select committee to whom was referred sundry
papers and letters, made the following report: which was unanimously
adopted.
To the honorable the consultation of all Texas, in general convention
assembled—
The select committee, to whom was referred the several letters from
General Austin, and other officers of the colonial army, near Bexar, and
sundry other communications and documents, connected with our mili<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tary
operations; respectfully reports—
That the communications of General Stephen F. Austin, of the fifth
instant, presents several matters interesting and important in our present
attitude of resistance against the destroyers of our constitution, and the
principles of a military despotism. The subjects are first presented for
your consideration, upon which your committee deem it proper to report.
First. The granting letters of marque and reprisal to cruisers upon
the high seas by the “provisional government of Texas.” This conven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
in adopting the declaration of the seventh of November, have or<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ganized
this power, and by the provisions of the resolution constituting a
provisional government, have vested this authority in the governor and
general council; consequently these requires no further action upon the
subject by this house during its present session.
The second contemplates an expedition from New Orleans against Mata<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moras.
This subject your committee regards as important, and concur
with the views of the commanding general, as to its certain effects of crip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pling
the enemy and distracting his movements. Your committee, how<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever,
from documents now in their possession, have it in their power to
inform this house, that a small force of one hundred and fifty men, com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />manded
by General Mexia, armed and equipped at his own expense, has
sailed from New Orleans for the port of Tampico, or Matamoras, and that
a descent from that quarter, from whatever source, in the opinion of your
committee, will produce the consequences of annoying the enemy at one
unexpected point, and prevent reinforcements being sent to Bexar.
Should further operations, hereafter, seem expedient in aiding the enter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />prise
of General Mexia, it enters into the duties of the governor and coun<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cil
of Texas.
Your committee feel bound to report to this house, the grateful emo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
induced by the disinterested off'er of Major Francis F. Belton, of
the United States army, to become the inspector of cannon, arms and
other military stores, to be purchased at New Orleans and Mobile, for the
use of Texas; and recommend that his services be accepted, and a vote
of thanks be passed and recorded upon the journals of this house, and that
a copy thereof be forwarded by the president to Major Belton; at the
same time informing him. of the appointment of Capt. E. Hall, an expe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rienced
officer, who is now engaged in performing the same duties, upon
a similar offer, who will be united with him.
Your committee in reporting the magnanimous and generous patriot<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ism
of Stephen F. Austin, J. W. Fannin and B. F. Smith, in their
( 536 )</p><pb n="537" xml:id="P0537" facs="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth5872/m1/545/" /><p>Journals of the Consultation.

prompt and voluntary offer, to place their lands and other property at
the disposal of this house, to he used as sureties for raising funds in aid
of their suffering country, at war with the enemies of their rights and
liberties; rejoice in seeing such noble acts recorded with the proceedings
of this body, in such time of difficulty and danger, and recommend a
letter of thanks, expressive of the grateful sense of this house, for offers
so benevolent and liberal, and that this house accept their several offers,
to be used only when imperiously demanded in the most extreme emer<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gency.

Your committee, before closing their report, would respectfully call the
attention of this house to the army now in the field. This force is com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />posed
of volunteers from every rank of citizens in the country, whose
services generally commenced before the assembling of this house, and as
their movements have hitherto been regulated by officers of their own
choice, no obligation can be imposed upon them to submit to the control
of the provisional government; advisory communications are all that can
be made to them, nevertheless, your committee recommends that every
honorable inducement .should be held out for their continuance in their
country’s service, at any rate until a regular army be ready to take the
field, and should Bexar so long hold out against their efforts. Already
have this house passed resolutions for their individual compensation,
when the resources of the country will permit. The land offices have been
closed, that no advantage should be taken over the soldier in the field in
making his selection of lands; the gratitude of this body, as the repre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sentatives
of the people of all Texas, has been twice expressed and entered
upon the journals of the house, and every effort used to afford supplies of
ammunition and provisions within the power of the late council, and
of this body; these efforts we recommend to be continued, and that this
house recommend the members of the army to elect such officers as are
wanting, and that all the officers report themselves to the governor and
council for commissions; that their respective ranks be known of record
for purposes obviously necessary for their future compensation, and that
of the soldiers under them, who may receive discharges from their re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />spective
officers, that they may be fully known when a grateful country
shall be able to express her thanks in bounties more substantial than mere
words. Your committee recommend that the army be encouraged to
persevere, with the assurance that every exertion will be used by the pro<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />visional
government, to aid, comfort and support it which it has within
its power, and will co-operate in forwarding its operations.
Your committee would suggest, that much encouragement is afforded
for perseverance in military operations, from the unsettled state of the
Mexican government. The apprehension of resistance from the citizens
of the republic, is admitted in a late report of a committee of congress,
contained in their plan of a form of government, intended to be enforced
upon the people by the exertion of military power, against their consent.
This disposition will prevent the usurper, Santa Anna, from reinforcing
the troops now arrayed against Texas; and gives hopes of a co-operation
of our Mexican brethren, in the glorious cause of liberty and the constitu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
in which Texas has set the noble example.
