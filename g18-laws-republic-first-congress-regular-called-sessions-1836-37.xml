a court martial shall be ordered to meet within thirty days, of the
time and place of which the officer arrested shall have at least twenty
days notice. And provided also, that if, upon the meeting of such
court, it shall appear that from the absence of witnesses, inability or
sickness of the parties, or for any good cause shown, a fair and im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />partial
trial could not then be had, they may adjourn the court to a
future day, not exceeding six months. A court for assessment

judgment should not be awarded against them, and to deliver
the opinions of the court, in every case, to the judge advocate,

and the court for that year shall be dissolved: provided, that
previous to their proceeding to do any business whatever, the mem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bers
and judge advocate composing the said court, take the follow<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
oath or affirmation, to wit: “We, and each of us, do swear (or
affirm) that we will truly and diligently enquire into and decide
upon the several delinquencies reported to us, and decide accord<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
to law and the best of our skill and understanding, without
favor or the hope of reward.” It shall be the duty of any officer
resigning or removing, to deliver the list of public arms and laws
that may be in his possession, to the commandant of the regiment
at the time of his resignation or removal, who shall deliver the
same to the successor of such officer.</p>

<p>Sec. 15. Be it further enacted, That there shall be, in the

shall be exempt therefrom, except from sickness, or some sufficient
cause: the rolls shall be called at each muster or review; and the
delinquents particularly noted by the captains of companies, both

year, on such days as the commanding officers of regiments shall
appoint, the whole of the commissioned officers, non-commis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sioned

<fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>

and the delinquents noted and returned as in other musters.
At all musters and reviews, and attendance on courts martial, no
persons are to give impediments or disturbance. Every officer and
private shall be free from arrest (except for breaches of the peace
or felony) whilst going to or returning from any review, muster,
or court martial; and any person or persons, other than those per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />forming
military duty, who will wilfully impede, or disturb any,
corps or court in their exercise or other duty, shall be appre<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hended
by the commanding officer, kept under guard for three days,
and fined not less than five dollars, nor more than one hundred
dollars; the said sum to be paid over to the regimental paymaster.
Returns shall be made by all officers commanding companies, to
those commanding battalions, one every year at least, in which shall
be expressed the strength of each company, and the number and
kind of every sort of arms and equipments therein; whose duty it
shall be to countersign them digested into battalion returns, and
deliver them to the officer commanding the regiment, who shall
cause a like regimental return to be made out and signed by him<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />self,
delivered to the brigadier general: the brigadier general shall
cause the brigade inspector to digest the whole regimental into one<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />general
brigade return; which shall be signed by the brigadier or
officer commanding the brigade, and transmitted to the adjutant
general, whose duty it shall be to have all such returns recorded
in a book to be kept for that purpose. The general of brigade shall,
without delay, have a copy of such return made out by the brigade
inspector, and sent to the major general or officer commanding
the division. The brigade inspectors, adjutants of regiments, and
commanding officers of companies, shall keep books, in which all
returns shall be duly recorded, and the casual occurrences noted.
On or before the fifteenth day of July in each year, the adjutants of
regiments shall receive from the commanding officers, the returns of
delinquents for that year, who shall record, and deliver them to the
regimental judge advocates at least five days before the sitting of the
court for the assessment of fines, in order that he may lay them be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fore
that body for adjudication. After the sitting of every court of
assessment, the judge advocate shall make out two fair copies of
their proceedings, one of which he shall deliver to the regimental
paymasters, and the other to the brigade general; both of whom
shall cause the same to be recorded. The regimental paymas<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ter
shall, on or before the first day of February in each year,
deliver to the high sheriff in each county, who shall, under the

penalty of fifty dollars, to be recovered by the paymaster in any
court having competent jurisdiction thereof, receive and receipt
for all lists and copies of judgments against all delinquents and de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />faulters,
as adjudged by the said court of assessment, and take his
receipt therefor; who shall thereupon apply for and receive the
same, and levy therefor, as in other cases, if payment is withheld;
for which the said sheriff shall receive the same fees and per centum
as are allowed by law for the collection of the public revenue. On
or before the first day of September in every year, the said sheriff
.shall settle with and pay over to the regimental paymaster, all sums
collected by him as aforesaid, and return upon oath an acocunt of
all insolvents and delinquents; recovering his commission as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />.said,
taking the said paymaster’s receipt therefor; an attested copy
of which he shall, within thirty days thereafter, transmit to the
general of brigade, and also have recorded in the court for the
county in which he is sheriff; but in the case the said sheriff fail or
refuse to pay and settle with the paymaster as aforesaid, the said
paymaster may immediately proceed to recover the monies due from
the said sheriff and his securities, in the same manner that monies
are recovered by the counties against their public collector.—Any
person aggrieved by any decision of any court of assessment, may
make affidavit thereof, and lodge the same with the judge advo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate
before the first day of February in each year, who thereupon
shall present the same at the succeeding annual term: whereupon
such grievance shall be reheard and decided upon; and if the former
judgment shall be affirmed, such applicant shall be charged with
fifty per cent, thereon, all of which the judge advocate shall record.
The regimental paymaster shall, before he acts as such, enter into
bond with sufficient security, in the county court, to the president
and his successors in office, in the sum of one thousand dollars, con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ditioned
for the just fulfilment of all the duties herein required of
him, which bond, shall not be void on the first recovery, and he
shall also take the following oath: “I do swear, 
that I will, as paymaster to      regi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
of militia, truly and honestly perform the said duty, and
render a just account to the best of my knowledge, when called
upon by the law or the proper authority.” And it shall be the
duty of the field officers of every regiment, to call upon and
settle with the paymaster annually; and they shall record a
return of such settlement in the court of their county, signed by
themselves, at the next court after the close of such settlements,

<fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the Republic of Texas.</fw>

and the clerk shall perform such service ex-officio, and shall also
sign a duplicate thereof, which shall be transmitted to the brig-,
adier general commanding the brigade, who shall cause the same to
be entered of' record by the brigade inspector. The monies col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lected
and funded with the regimental paymaster shall be subject
to orders drawn by the commandant of the regiment, for regi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />mental
purposes, and to the orders of the major or brigadier gen<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />eral
for any purpose immediately affecting the interest of the regi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment
or corps from whose paymaster the sum is drawn; all which
orders shall be regularly filed and preserved by the paymaster,
as vouchers in his annual settlement, for all and every duty herein
specified. The said paymaster shall receive and be entitled to ten
per cent, per annum, on all sums actually received and paid away.
It shall be the duty of the adjutant general to call for any returns
judged necessary by the president; and to furnish to each brigade
forms thereof: and in like manner every commandant of division,
brigade, or corps, are to be implicitly obeyed, when they may think
it necessary to call for returns of their respective commands.
Every division, brigade, and regiment shall be kept fully officered;
and rosters in each shall be prepared by the proper officer, by
which the detail of duty shall be regulated.</p>

<p>Sec. 16. And be it further enacted, That the president for the
time being, when he deems it necessary, shall call forth into the
service of this republic, such a number of militia as he shall deem
expedient; a tour of duty shall be estimated at three months; and,
when employed in the service of the republic, no militia shall be
compelled to serve more than two tours without discharge. The
militia, when in service,' shall be governed by the articles of war,
and the rules and regulations adopted for the army of the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />public,
and receive the same pay and rations as said army. When<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ever
a new regiment shall be, ordered by the president,
the field officers composing it shall meet and lay off the
district into bounds for the companies; but at no time
shall a company consist of less than thirty-two privates, and if at
any time a company shall be reduced to a less number, it shall
be incorporated with the adjoining companies, while such disa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />bilities
exist. Every officer commissioned (under this law) by
president shall be implicitly obeyed as such, and shall continue
to hold his commission for the space of two years from the date
of his commission, unless he removes from the district in which
his command operates. All courts martial, and of assessment,
shall issue summons for witnesses, who shall attend; the process

may be served by any constable or sheriff, and if such witnesses
shall not attend, without a good excuse, he shall be fined. The
president or any field officer may subpoena witnesses previous to
the sitting of the court, and it is hereby directed that the several
courts possess competent powers to carry into execution the regula<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tions
granted or analagous to their institution. In all courts mar<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tial,
any person to be tried may make objections to any member or
members composing the said court (not exceeding three) per<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />emptorily,
and assign his reasons for objections to others; if they
are such as to evince their propriety, another or other members
shall be summoned; otherwise the court shall be deemed compe<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tent
except the peremptory challenge. Parents and guardians shall
be accountable for fines of their children, wares, &amp;c., who are under
twenty-one years of age: and it is hereby declared to every officer,
non-commissioned officer, musician, and private, that the duties
herein directed, are to be specifically and positively performed; and

may be rewarded or punished as their conduct may really deserve.</p>

<p>Art. 5. He shall direct the crews of the respective vessels under
his command to be frequently mustered, and cause inquiries to be

in which they may be rated.</p>

<p>Art. 6. He shall inspect into the state of every vessel under

command.</p>

<p>Art. 20. Foreign agents are to be paid by bills drawn on
the secretary of the navy, at the regular rates of exchange, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />less'

and stores as they stand in need of; giving the officers hav<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing
charge of them written orders to that effect, and taking from

to recover the anchor or cable lost; and should it ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear
that no exertion for that purpose was made by him, the
value of the articles will be charged against his pay; if the ves<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sel

unless when mustered, or called to quarters; should they ne<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />glect

of the commander, may consider most proper for their recep<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion,
the situation having been previously arranged.</p>

<p>Art.  11. A variety of cases may occur, when, for the preserva<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion
of the lives of the sick, as well as for the safety of those who

precaution to prevent the origin or progress of contagion, on the ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pearance
of which he shall, without delay, report the case to the
commander, in order that a timely separation may be made of the
sick from the well, and adopt such measures as may have a ten<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dency
to arrest the progress of the disease.</p>

<p>Art. 17. He shall frequently inspect the provisions and
liquors which may be served out, and report the same to the

personal cleanliness; in short, every thing which may come
